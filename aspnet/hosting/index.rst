Hosting
=======

By `Sourabh Shirhatti`_

The hosting docs provide an overview of how to host ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET hosting providers will be able to use the setup and configuration recommendations to integrate ASP.NET Core into their hosting solution. This document should also serve as a guide for any environment where multiple discrete users will be running web sites on a single server or web farm.
