> This article refers to ASP.NET SignalR. If you're thinking about using SignalR to enable real-time scenarios with Java, Node.js, or in a serverless scenario, take a look at [ASP.NET Core SignalR](/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction). If you've already used ASP.NET SignalR, take a look at the [version differences](/aspnet/core/signalr/version-differences) page to understand the differences in the versions and the improvements we've made in ASP.NET Core SignalR. Finally, if you know you'll be running your real-time apps in Microsoft Azure, take a look at the [Azure SignalR Service](/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-overview), as it provides cloud-based scale-out once your apps need it.
