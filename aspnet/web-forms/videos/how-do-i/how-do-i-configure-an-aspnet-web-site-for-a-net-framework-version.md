[How Do I:] Configure an ASP.NET Web Site for a .NET Framework Version
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to configure an ASP.NET web site to use a specific version of ASP.NET/.NET Framework. First see how to identify what version of the .NET Framework a web site is associated with by viewing the script map in Internet Information Server (IIS). See how a script map is associated with the root in IIS and then with individual web sites. Next learn about the ASP.NET IIS Registration tool (aspnet\_regiis.exe) used to configure IIS or an ASP.NET web site to use a specific version of the .NET Framework. Using this information see how a single web site is configured to use a different version of the .NET Framework than is the default to IIS. Finally, see two different web sites under the same IIS where one is running under .NET Framework 2.0 and the other under 1.1.
