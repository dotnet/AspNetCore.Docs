[How Do I:] Save and Load View State Information for a Custom Web Server Control
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to persist and restore information in the ViewState of a custom user control. First, learn how to persist simple values containing .NET primitive types such as String, Int32, Boolean, etc. Then see how to persist complex types such as Class which contain properties storing information. The sequence of processing View State information during the lifecycle of an ASP.NET page is also discussed.
