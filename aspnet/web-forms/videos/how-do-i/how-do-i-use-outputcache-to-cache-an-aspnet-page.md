[How Do I:] Use OutputCache to Cache an ASP.NET Page
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to utilize the built-in caching of ASP.NET to store a page in the cache so it does not have to be re-rendered. First, the simplest form of page caching is demonstrated where the entire page is cached for a specified period of time. Next, a more granular approach is taken where the values of QueryString variables are used as the basis for caching pages. Finally, see how to have the type of browser be the basis for caching a page.
