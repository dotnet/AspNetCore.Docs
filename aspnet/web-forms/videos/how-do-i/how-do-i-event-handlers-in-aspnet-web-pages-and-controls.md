[How Do I:] Event Handlers in ASP.NET Web Pages and Controls
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to create event handlers for ASP.NET web pages and web server controls. First, learn how to create page level events for the standard page events provided by the .NET Framework. See how to automatically bind the events to a page using the AutoEventWireup attribute as well as programmatically bind the events. Next, learn how to create and bind event handlers for the standard web server control events. Also learn how to connect multiple events for different controls to the same event handler. Finally, see the usage of the AutoPostbackTrue property for web server controls.
