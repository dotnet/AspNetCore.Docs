[How Do I:] Add Controls to an ASP.NET Web Page Programmatically
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to create an ASP.NET server control programmatically at runtime and add it to a page. First, learn the basic concept of adding a control to a page programmatically. Then, the concept of a "container" control is examined which is necessary for adding a new control programmatically at runtime. Next, learn considerations for nesting programmatically added controls, and how creating separate methods can compartmentalize the process to make it more maintainable. In addition, learn considerations for managing view state when adding controls dynamically.
