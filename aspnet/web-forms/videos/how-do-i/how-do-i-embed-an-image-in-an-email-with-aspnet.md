[How Do I:] Embed an Image in an Email with ASP.NET
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

Chris Pels shows how to embed an image in an email with ASP.NET. He creates a web form (with fields for To, From, Subject, and Body), uses the AlternateView class to create text and HTML versions of an email, stores an image in a LinkedResource class instance, embeds it in the HTML AlternateView. He then adds both versions to the MailMessage object and sends the email twice, first with HTML-receiving capabilities enabled and then as text-only. Both email messages appear in Outlook. The HTML version shows the embedded image; the text version does not.
