[How Do I:] Work with Master Pages Declaratively and Programmatically
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show several aspects of defining and using master pages in an ASP.NET web site. First, see how to create master pages declaratively using the ASP.NET master page model and learn what information is best suited to a master page compared to an individual content page. Next, see how to programmatically assign master pages on-the-fly in an individual content page. Also learn how to create a base page class which assigns a master page programmatically for all pages that inherit from the base class. In addition, see how to set the master page in the web.config file. Lastly, see how to access elements in a master page from an individual content page including some best practices for structuring access to master page elements.
