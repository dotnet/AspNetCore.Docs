[How Do I:] Create a Reusable Component for Sending Email to a Distribution List
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to create a component that can be used on multiple web pages and web sites that sends emails to a list of recipients. First, the ASP.NET web site will be configured to send email using the &lt;mailSettings&gt; in the web.config file. Then a class and several methods are created to read a list of recipients from a data source (DB, XML, etc.) and send an email message to each of the recipients using the System.Net.Mail classes. As part of this process exception handling is included. In addition, a user interface is created to allow the user to specify items such as the From address, Subject, add an attachment, etc.
