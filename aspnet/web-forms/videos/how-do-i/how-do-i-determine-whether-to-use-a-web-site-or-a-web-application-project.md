[How Do I:] Determine Whether to Use a Web Site or a Web Application Project
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will contrast the differences between an ASP.NET web site project and a web application project. Learn the considerations for using one type of project or the other. First, learn about the major attributes of a web application project including its folder basis. Next, see the major attributes of a web site project and its traditional Visual Studio project based nature which provides more granularity and flexibility including adding classes, dealing with namespaces, and referencing user controls or pages programmatically. The compilation model for each type of web site is then discussed along with alternatives that include the use of the aspnet\_compiler.exe and aspnet\_merge.exe utilities and the Visual Studio 2008 web deployment project.
