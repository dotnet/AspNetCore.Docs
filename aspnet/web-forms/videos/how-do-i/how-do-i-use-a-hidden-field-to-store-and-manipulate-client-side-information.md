[How Do I:] Use a Hidden Field to Store and Manipulate Client-Side Information
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to use a hidden field as one approach to simple state management on an ASP.NET page and for communicating client side processing information. First, see how to add a hidden field to a page using an ASP.NET HiddenField server control and retrieve the value of the hidden field in server-side code after a post-back. Next, learn how to manipulate the value of the hidden field in client-side script, and then retrieve the modified value in server-side code. Finally, see an example of how to use several hidden fields to store information from client-side processing that can be posted back for server processing.
