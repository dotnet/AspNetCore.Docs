[How Do I:] Handle Events in Master and Content Pages
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how events are handled in master and individual content pages. Even though the end result of a master and individual content page is a single ASP.NET page rendered in the user's browser the event handling in each type of page is handled separately. If a control is located in the master page the corresponding event handler is located in the master page by default. The same is true for controls in the content page. See two approaches to having the events for a control located in the master page handled in the code behind of the content page. This allows "communication" between the master page and content page.
