[How Do I:] Make HTML elements accessible from server side code
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to make standard HTML elements in an .aspx page accessible from server side code so they can be used in page processing like a standard ASP.NET server control. First, see how the addition of a runat="server" attribute to a standard HTML control like a &lt;div&gt; allows it to be referenced in server side code with full Intellisense. Next, see several examples of how you might manipulate HTML elements on a page with this technique. Lastly, see how this technique can be used in conjunction with the new ListView control in .NET Framework Version 3.5 to control the layout of a list.
