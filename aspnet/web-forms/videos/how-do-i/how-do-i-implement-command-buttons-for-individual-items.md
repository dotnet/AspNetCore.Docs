[How Do I:] Implement Command Buttons for Individual Items
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to handle events associated with a button control in each item of a data-bound control like a ListView control. First, see how these data-bound controls have standard button event handlers for standard operations like Edit or Delete. Next, learn how to add a button which performs a custom action and how to handle events for this custom button action. Finally, see how to pass data to the custom event handler for identification of the item where the button click originated.
