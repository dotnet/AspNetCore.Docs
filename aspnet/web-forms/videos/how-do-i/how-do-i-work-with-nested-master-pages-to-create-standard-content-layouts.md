[How Do I:] Work with Nested Master Pages to Create Standard Content Layouts
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to use nested master pages to create individual master pages that represent different standard content layouts for a web site. First, see how several major commercial web sites use a standard set of content layouts. Next, see how to nest a master page within another master page, and use the design time support in Visual Studio 2008. Then, learn the considerations for establishing a "page architecture" which represents the major types of content layout used in a sample web site. Once that definition is complete see how to structure the nested master pages so developers can then select a master page, resulting in a standardized and consistent display of content for a web site.
