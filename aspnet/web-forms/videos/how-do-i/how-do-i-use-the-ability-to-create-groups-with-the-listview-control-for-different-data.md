[How Do I:] Use the Ability to Create Groups with the ListView Control for Different Data
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to group items when displaying data in a ListView control. First, see the basics of item layout in the ListView control with the LayoutTemplate and the ItemTemplate. Then, learn how the GroupTemplate relates to the LayoutTemplate and ItemTemplate within a ListView to establish a group of data. See how to use floating DIV elements to create a flexible tabular layout since any of the templates used with the ListView can contain any HTML. This provides significant flexibility in creating groupings of data using the ListView control. Finally, see some options for enhancing the look by manipulating the CSS styles used in the ListView templates and how to use the GroupSeparatorTemplate as well as the EmptyItemTemplate.
