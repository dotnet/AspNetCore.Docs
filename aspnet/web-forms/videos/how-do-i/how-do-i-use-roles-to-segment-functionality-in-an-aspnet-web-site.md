[How Do I:] Use Roles to Segment Functionality in an ASP.NET Web Site
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to maximize the use of roles in an ASP.NET web site after setting up ASP.NET Membership. First, learn how to setup roles using the built-in role manager in Visual Studio .NET. See how to define roles based upon the business needs associated with the web site. Once the roles are setup learn how to structure your web site from a folder and page hierarchy perspective to most efficiently accommodate the roles and business needs. As part of this see how to use the roles attribute in defining authorization in the web.config file associated with each folder. Also, see how to use the &lt;location&gt; element to apply authorization settings to a specific location such as a page.
