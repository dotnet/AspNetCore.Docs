[How Do I:] Create and Use a Custom Configuration Section in an ASP.NET Configuration File
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to extend the standard set of ASP.NET configuration settings with your own XML configuration elements. First, see how to create a configuration section handler which is required to interpret and process the information in custom XML configuration elements. During this learn how to use declarative model for defining the behavior of a configuration section handler. Next, see how to add a custom section handler and custom elements to an ASP.NET configuration file. Finally, see how to programmatically access the custom configuration data.
