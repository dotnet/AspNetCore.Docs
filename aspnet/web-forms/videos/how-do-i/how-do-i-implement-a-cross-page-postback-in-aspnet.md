[How Do I:] Implement a Cross Page PostBack in ASP.NET
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to create a Cross Page PostBack in ASP.NET, where a control on a source page raises a PostBack event to a different target page. First, learn how to configure a Button control to PostBack to a different target page. Then, learn how to get information from controls on the source page with the PreviousPage property and the FindControl method. Then, learn how to use public properties on the source page to expose data to the target page, and learn how to use the @PreviousPageType directive on the target page to access these properties. Finally, learn the difference between a Cross Page PostBack and the Server.Transfer method.
