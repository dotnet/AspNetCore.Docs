[How Do I:] Use Control State to Persist Information for a Custom Web Server Control
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to store information related to a custom web server control in the control state which is independent of the ViewState information for the control. Unlike ViewState the control state can not be turned off and is therefore a more reliable way to store important information for a control. A discussion of what types of information are appropriate to store in control state is also included.
