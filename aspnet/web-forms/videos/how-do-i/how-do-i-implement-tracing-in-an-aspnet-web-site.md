[How Do I:]  Implement Tracing in an ASP.NET Web Site?
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show you how to implement tracing in an ASP.NET web site to monitor or measure the performance and to diagnose errors. Learn how to add tracing to an entire web site as well as individual pages. See how to add custom trace messages in pages and business objects to aid in assessing site performance and in diagnosing errors. Learn the differences between tracing in an ASP.NET page and in using System.Diagnostics.Trace for tracing information in business objects. Writing trace information to log files and viewing trace information in the trace viewer are also discussed.
