[How Do I:] Share Data Between Client JavaScript and Server Code Using a Hidden Field
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to share data in between JavaScript and server-side code by using a hidden field in an ASP.NET page. Next, learn how to use the RegisterHiddenField method in server-side code to programmatically create a hidden field on the client. In addition, see how to programmatically create a HiddenField server control for sharing data on an ASP.NET page. Finally, use the RegisterArrayDeclaration method to create a container in server code for storing multiple values that is rendered to the page where it can be accessed by JavaScript.
