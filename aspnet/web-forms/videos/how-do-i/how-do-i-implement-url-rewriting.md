[How Do I:] Implement URL Rewriting?
====================
by [Scott Golightly](https://github.com/scottgolightly)

In this video Scott Golightly shows how to create an ASP.NET HttpModule to "rewrite" the URL when a request for a web page comes in. You may want to rewrite URLs to create friendly URLs or to direct an old URL to a new URL. We will look at the code needed to implement URL rewriting and also how to handle page post back events.
