How Do I: Use the ViewStateMode Property for Managing ViewState?
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video [Chris Pels](http://www.idevtech.com) shows how to use the ViewStateMode property when designing ViewState for a web site in ASP.NET. First, the functionality for managing ViewState in ASP.NET prior to ASP.NET 4 is discussed. Next, the ViewStateMode property added in ASP.NET 4 is demonstrated both at the page level and in a sample page with nested child controls. The importance of the hierarchical inheritance of the ViewStateMode property is discussed. Finally, a sample scenario for minimizing ViewState on ASP.NET pages is demonstrated.
