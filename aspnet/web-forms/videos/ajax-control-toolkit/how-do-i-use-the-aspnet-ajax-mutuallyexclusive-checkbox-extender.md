[How Do I:] Use the ASP.NET AJAX MutuallyExclusive Checkbox Extender?
====================
by [Joe Stagner](https://github.com/JoeStagner)

The MutuallyExclusive control from the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit enables the developer to configure a number of check boxes as mutually exclusive, which ensures the user may only check a single option. While a radio-button list provides similar behavior, the need for a check box to be clicked by the user makes the MutuallyExclusive control ideal for receiving confirmation from the user, such as accepting or not accepting terms of use.
