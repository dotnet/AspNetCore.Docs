[How Do I:] Automate Testing using Team Build?
====================
by [Chris Menegay](https://twitter.com/CMenegay)

In this video we learn how to use Visual Studio Team System to define the automated tests that will run during a team build, and how we can drill down in to the results of those tests. We also learn that the [Test Tools Build Task](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718351.aspx#bttt) provides an alternative way of specifying the tests to run during a team build.
