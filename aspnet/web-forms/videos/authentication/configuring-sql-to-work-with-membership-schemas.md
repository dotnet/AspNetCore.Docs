====================
by [Joe Stagner](https://github.com/JoeStagner)

In this video Joe Stagner demonstrates how to configure a SQL instance to work with a specific ASP Services Membership Profile; as well as configure the application to specifically use this SQL instance and not the default settings in the machine.cgf file. For additional information about this video, read the [Creating the Membership Schema in SQL Server](../../overview/older-versions-security/membership/creating-the-membership-schema-in-sql-server-vb.md) security tutorial.
