How Do I: Make Ajax Calls Using jQuery?
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to make Ajax calls using the jQuery library. A sample web site is created that contains a simple web service which returns a value. Next, the jQuery ajax() method is used to call the web service. A number of the ajax() method options are set including url, dataType, data, etc. In addition, event handlers for both success and error conditions are defined. Another web services is then defined which accepts an argument and also returns a value. A second ajax() call is defined that passes a value to the web service call and processes the return data. Finally, the setup for global options and event handlers for ajax() method calls are discussed.
