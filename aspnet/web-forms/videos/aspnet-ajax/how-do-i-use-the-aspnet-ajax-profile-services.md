[How Do I:] Use the ASP.NET AJAX Profile Services?
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

ASP.NET 2.0 introduced [Profile properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/at64shx3.aspx) with which you can store details for each user of your ASP.NET Web application. ASP.NET AJAX Profile Services allow your client-side Web interface to retrieve a user's Profile properties from the server-side Web application. This video demonstrates how a sample AJAX-enabled travel site can store the travel request information of a user so that the details can be retrieved when he or she next visits the site.
