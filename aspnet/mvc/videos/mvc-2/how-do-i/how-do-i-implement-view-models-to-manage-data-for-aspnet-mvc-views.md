How Do I: Implement View  Models to Manage Data for ASP.NET MVC Views?
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to use the concept of a "View Model" for managing data for ASP.NET MVC views. First, a sample MVC project is created that uses a ViewDataDictionary to package and pass data from a controller to a view. Next, a class is created which represents a view model for a view in the sample MVC project. As part of this implementation, the advantages of the view model approach are discussed. Finally, there is a discussion of how to partition the application logic when using a view model implementation.
