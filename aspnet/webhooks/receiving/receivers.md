# ASP.NET WebHooks receivers

Receiving WebHooks depends on who the sender is. Sometimes there are additional steps registering a WebHook verifying that the subscriber is really listening. Some WebHooks provide a push-to-pull model where the HTTP POST request only contains a reference to the event information which is then to be retrieved independently. Often the security model varies quite a bit.

The purpose of Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks is to make it both simpler and more consistent to wire up your API without spending a lot of time figuring out how to handle any particular variant of WebHooks.

A WebHook receiver is responsible for accepting and verifying WebHooks from a particular sender. A WebHook receiver can support any number of WebHooks, each with their own configuration. For example, the GitHub WebHook receiver can accept WebHooks from any number of GitHub repositories.

## WebHook Receiver URIs

By installing Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks you get a general WebHook controller which accepts WebHook requests from an open-ended number of services. When a request arrives, it picks the appropriate receiver that you have installed for handling a particular WebHook sender.

The URI of this controller is the WebHook URI that you register with the service and is of the form:

<!-- literal_block {"names": [], "classes": [], "dupnames": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "backrefs": [], "ids": []} -->

```
https://<host>/api/webhooks/incoming/<receiver>/{id}
```

For security reasons, many WebHook receivers require that the URI is an *https* URI and in some cases it must also contain an additional query parameter which is used to enforce that only the intended party can send WebHooks to the URI above.

The *<receiver>* component is the name of the receiver, for example *github* or *slack*.

The *{id}* is an optional identifier which can be used to identify a particular WebHook receiver configuration. This can be used to register N WebHooks with a particular receiver. For example, the following three URIs can be used to register for three independent WebHooks:

<!-- literal_block {"names": [], "classes": [], "dupnames": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "backrefs": [], "ids": []} -->

```
https://<host>/api/webhooks/incoming/github
https://<host>/api/webhooks/incoming/github/12345
https://<host>/api/webhooks/incoming/github/54321
```

## Installing a WebHook Receiver

To receive WebHooks using Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks, you first install the Nuget package for the WebHook provider or providers you want to receive WebHooks from. The Nuget packages are named [Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers.*](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers) where the last part indicates the service supported. For example

[Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers.GitHub](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers.GitHub) provides support for receiving WebHooks from GitHub and [Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers.Custom](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers.Custom) provides support for receiving WebHooks generated by ASP.NET WebHooks.

Out of the box you can find support for Dropbox, GitHub, MailChimp, PayPal, Pusher, Salesforce, Slack, Stripe, Trello, and WordPress but it is possible to support any number of other providers.

## Configuring a WebHook Receiver

WebHook Receivers are configured through the [IWebHookReceiverConfig](https://github.com/aspnet/WebHooks/blob/master/src/Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers/WebHooks/IWebHookReceiverConfig.cs) inteface and particular implementations of that interface can be registered using any dependency injection model. The default implementation uses Application Settings which can either be set in the Web.config file, or, if using Azure Web Apps, can be set through the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

The format for Application Setting keys is as follows:

<!-- literal_block {"names": [], "classes": [], "dupnames": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "backrefs": [], "ids": []} -->

```
MS_WebHookReceiverSecret_<receiver>
````

The value is a comma-separated list of values matching the *{id}* values for which WebHooks have been registered, for example:

<!-- literal_block {"names": [], "classes": [], "dupnames": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "backrefs": [], "ids": []} -->

```
MS_WebHookReceiverSecret_GitHub = <secret1>, 12345=<secret2>, 54321=<secret3>
```

## Initializing a WebHook Receiver

WebHook Receivers are initialized by registering them, typically in the *WebApiConfig* static class, for example:

<!-- literal_block {"names": [], "classes": [], "dupnames": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "backrefs": [], "ids": []} -->

```csharp
namespace WebHookReceivers
{
    public static class WebApiConfig
    {
        public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
        {
            // Web API configuration and services

            // Web API routes
            config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();

            config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
                name: "DefaultApi",
                routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
                defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
            );

            // Load receivers
            config.InitializeReceiveGitHubWebHooks();
        }
    }
}
```
