More Patterns and Guidance (Building Real-World Cloud Apps with Azure)
====================
by [Mike Wasson](https://github.com/MikeWasson), [Rick Anderson](https://github.com/Rick-Anderson), [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra)

[Download Fix It Project](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Fix-It-app-for-Building-cdd80df4) or [Download E-book](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2014/07/23/free-ebook-building-cloud-apps-with-microsoft-azure.aspx)

> The **Building Real World Cloud Apps with Azure** e-book is based on a presentation developed by Scott Guthrie. It explains 13 patterns and practices that can help you be successful developing web apps for the cloud. For information about the e-book, see [the first chapter](introduction.md).


You've now seen 13 patterns that provide guidance on how to be successful in cloud computing. These are just a few of the patterns that apply to cloud apps. Here are some more cloud computing topics, and resources to help with them:

- Migrating existing on-premises applications to the cloud. 

    - [Moving Applications to the Cloud](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff728592.aspx). E-book by Microsoft Patterns and Practices. Also available as a [hard-copy paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1621140202).
    - [Migrating Microsoft's ASP.NET and IIS.NET](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=400656). Case study by Robert McMurray.
    - [Moving 4th &amp; Mayor to Azure Web Sites](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2013/04/4thandmayor-azure-websites/). Blog post by Jeff Wilcox chronicling his experience moving a web app from Amazon Web Services to Web Apps in Azure App Service.
    - [Moving Apps to Azure: What changes?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/videos/web-sites-internals-and-the-file-system/) Short video by Stefan Schackow, explains file system access in Web Apps in Azure App Service.

## Resources

Each of the chapters in this e-book provides links to resources for more information about that specific topic. The following list provides links to overviews of best practices and recommended patterns for successful cloud development with Azure.

Documentation

- [Best Practices for the Design of Large-Scale Services on Azure Cloud Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj717232.aspx). White paper by Mark Simms and Michael Thomassy.
- [Failsafe: Guidance for Resilient Cloud Architectures](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj853352.aspx). White paper by Marc Mercuri, Ulrich Homann, and Andrew Townhill. Web page version of the FailSafe video series.
- [Azure Guidance](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/net/guidance/) Portal page for official documentation related to developing applications for Azure.

Videos

- [Building Real World Cloud Apps with Azure - Part 1](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2013/AZR324) and [Part 2](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2013/AZR325). Video of the presentation by Scott Guthrie that this e-book is based on. Presented at Tech Ed Australia in September, 2013. An earlier version of the same presentation was delivered at Norwegian Developers Conference (NDC) in June, 2013: [NDC part 1](http://vimeo.com/68215538), [NDC part 2](http://vimeo.com/68215602).
- [FailSafe: Building Scalable, Resilient Cloud Services](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/FailSafe). Nine-part video series by Ulrich Homann, Marc Mercuri, and Mark Simms. Presents a 400-level view of how to architect cloud apps. This series focuses on theory and reasons behind recommended patterns; for more how-to details, see the Building Big series by Mark Simms.
- [Building Big: Lessons learned from Azure customers- Part 1](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-029) and [Part 2](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-030). Two-part video series by Simon Davies and Mark Simms, similar to the FailSafe series but oriented more toward practical implementation.

Code sample

- [The Fix It application that accompanies this e-book](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Fix-It-app-for-Building-cdd80df4?cdn_id=2013-12-03-002).
- [Cloud Service Fundamentals in Azure in C# for Visual Studio 2012](http://aka.ms/csf). Downloadable project in the Microsoft Code Gallery site, includes both code and documentation developed by the Microsoft Customer Advisory Team (CAT). Demonstrates many of the best practices advocated in the FailSafe and Building Big video series and the FailSafe white paper. The Code Gallery page also links to extensive documentation by the authors of the project -- see especially the [Cloud Service Fundamentals wiki collection](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/17987.cloud-service-fundamentals.aspx) link in the blue box near the top of the project description. This project and the documentation for it still actively being developed, making it a better choice for information on many topics than similar but older white papers.

Finally, when you get started building real-world apps and running them in Azure, sooner or later you'll probably need assistance from experts. You can ask questions in community sites such as [Azure forums or StackOverflow](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/forums/), or you can contact Microsoft directly for Azure support. Microsoft offers several levels of technical support Azure: for a summary and comparison of the options, see [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/plans/).
