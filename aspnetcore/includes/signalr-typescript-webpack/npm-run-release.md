This command generates the client-side assets to be served when running the app. The assets are placed in the `wwwroot` folder.

Webpack completed the following tasks:

* Purged the contents of the `wwwroot` directory.
* Converted the TypeScript to JavaScript in a process known as *transpilation*.
* Mangled the generated JavaScript to reduce file size in a process known as *minification*.
* Copied the processed JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files from `src` to the `wwwroot` directory.
* Injected the following elements into the `wwwroot/index.html` file:
  * A `<link>` tag, referencing the `wwwroot/main.<hash>.css` file. This tag is placed immediately before the closing `</head>` tag.
  * A `<script>` tag, referencing the minified `wwwroot/main.<hash>.js` file. This tag is placed immediately before the closing `</body>` tag.
