The Contoso University web app demonstrates how to create Razor Pages web apps using EF Core and Visual Studio. For information about the tutorial series, see [the first tutorial](xref:data/ef-rp/intro).

If you run into problems you can't solve, download the [completed app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/data/ef-rp/intro/samples) and compare that code to what you created by following the tutorial.
