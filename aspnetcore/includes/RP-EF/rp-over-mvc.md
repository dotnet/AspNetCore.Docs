This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core with controllers and views. [Razor Pages](xref:razor-pages/index) is an alternative programming model. For new development, we recommend Razor Pages over MVC with controllers and views. See the [Razor Pages](xref:data/ef-rp/intro) version of this tutorial. Each tutorial covers some material the other doesn't:

Some things this MVC tutorial has that the Razor Pages tutorial doesn't:

* Implement inheritance in the data model
* Perform raw SQL queries
* Use dynamic LINQ to simplify code

Some things the Razor Pages tutorial has that this one doesn't:

* Use Select method to load related data
* Best practices for EF.
