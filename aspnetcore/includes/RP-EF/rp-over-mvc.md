This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a new alternative in ASP.NET Core 2.0, a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. We recommend the [Razor Pages](xref:data/ef-rp/intro) tutorial over the MVC version. The Razor Pages tutorial:

* Is easier to follow.
* Provides more EF Core best practices.
* Uses more efficient queries.
* Is more current with the lastest API.
* Covers more features.
* Is the preferred approach for new application development.
