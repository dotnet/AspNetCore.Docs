> [!NOTE]
> You may not be able to enter decimal commas in decimal fields. To support [jQuery validation](https://jqueryvalidation.org/) for non-English locales that use a comma (",") for a decimal point, and non US-English date formats, you must take steps to globalize your app. [See this GitHub comment 4076](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/4076#issuecomment-1153254062) for instructions on adding decimal comma.
