Include either this file or 'not-latest-version.md' at the top of articles.

'not-latest-version.md': Includes not-supported content.
'not-latest-version-without-not-supported-content.md' (this file): Doesn't include not-supported content.

Use this file in articles that target >=8.0 until 9.0 reaches EOL, and then update those
articles to use 'not-latest-version.md'. For articles that target >=7.0, 'not-latest-version.md'
can be used without creating a zone/file moniker range mismatch error.

When a new version is released, it might be necessary to temporarily comment out the current version
moniker range section until the new moniker is created.
