> Azure SQL Database should use [Managed Identities for Azure resources](/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/azure-active-directory-authentication#using-managed-identity-authentication) instead of the flow described in this tutorial. For non-Azure apps, use a secure authentication flow similar to [Managed Identities for Azure resources](/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/azure-active-directory-authentication#using-managed-identity-authentication).
