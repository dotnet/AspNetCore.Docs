The Visual Studio Code instructions use the .NET CLI for ASP.NET Core development functions such as project creation. You can follow these instructions on macOS, Linux, or Windows and with any code editor. Minor changes may be required if you use an integrated development environment (IDE) other than Visual Studio Code.
