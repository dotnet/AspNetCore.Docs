This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC with controllers and views using [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/). Razor Pages is a new alternative in ASP.NET Core 2.0, a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. We recommend you try the [Razor Pages](xref:mvc/razor-pages/index) tutorial before the MVC version. The Razor Pages tutorial:

* Is easier to follow.
* Covers more features.
* Is the preferred approach for new application development.
