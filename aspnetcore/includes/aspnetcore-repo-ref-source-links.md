> [!NOTE]
> Documentation links to .NET reference source usually load the repository's default branch, which represents the current development for the next release of .NET. To select the branch for a different release, use the **Switch branches or tags** dropdown list. The ASP.NET Core repository uses a "`release/{VERSION}`" format for release branch names, where the `{VERSION}` placeholder is the release version. For example, select the `release/6.0` branch for the ASP.NET Core 6.0 release. Other reference source repositories may use different release tag naming schemes. For more information, see [this GitHub discussion issue](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/26203).
