> [!WARNING]
> This article shows the use of connection strings. When using a local database for development and testing, database user authentication via the connection string isn't required. In production environments, connection strings sometimes include a password to authenticate database access or database operations. A resource owner password credential (ROPC) in a connection string is a security risk to avoid in production apps. Production apps should use the most secure authentication flow available. For more information on authentication for apps deployed to test or production environments, see <xref:security/index#secure-authentication-flows>.
