> This article shows the use of connection strings. With a local database the user doesn't have to be authenticated, but in production, connection strings sometimes include a password to authenticate. A resource owner password credential (ROPC) is a security risk that should be avoided in production databases. Production apps should use the most secure authentication flow available. For more information on authentication for apps deployed to test or production environments, see [Secure authentication flows](xref:security/index#secure-authentication-flows).
