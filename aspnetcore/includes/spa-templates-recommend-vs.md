Visual Studio provides project templates for creating single-page apps (SPAs) based on JavaScript frameworks such as [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) that have an ASP.NET Core backend. These templates:

* Create a Visual Studio solution with a frontend project and a backend project.
* Use the Visual Studio project type for JavaScript and TypeScript (*.esproj*) for the frontend.
* Use an ASP.NET Core project for the backend.
