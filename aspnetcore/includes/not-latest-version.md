Include either this file or 'not-latest-version-without-not-supported-content.md' at the top 
of articles.

'not-latest-version.md' (this file): Includes not-supported content.
'not-latest-version-without-not-supported-content.md': Doesn't include not-supported content.

Use this file in articles that target >=7.0. For articles that target >=8.0 prior to 9.0
reaching EOL, 'not-latest-version-without-not-supported-content.md' must be used to avoid
a zone/file moniker range mismatch error.

When a new version is released, it might be necessary to temporarily comment out the current 
version moniker range section until the new moniker is created.
