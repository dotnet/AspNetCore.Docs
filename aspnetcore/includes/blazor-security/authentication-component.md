The page produced by the `Authentication` component (*Pages/Authentication.razor*) defines the routes required for handling different authentication stages.

The `RemoteAuthenticatorView` component:

* Is provided by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication` package.
* Manages performing the appropriate actions at each stage of authentication.

```razor
@page "/authentication/{action}"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication

<RemoteAuthenticatorView Action="@Action" />

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Action { get; set; }
}
```
