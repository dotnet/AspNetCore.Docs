The Visual Studio Code instructions use the .NET Core CLI for ASP.NET Core development functions such as project creation. You can follow these instructions on any platform (macOS, Linux, or Windows) and with any code editor. Minor changes may be required if you use something other than Visual Studio Code. For more information on installing Visual Studio Code on macOS, see [Visual Studio Code on macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).
