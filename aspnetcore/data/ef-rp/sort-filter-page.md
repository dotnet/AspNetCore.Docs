# Sorting, filtering, paging, and grouping - EF Core with Razor Pages (3 of 10)

By [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra), [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT), and [Jon P Smith](https://twitter.com/thereformedprog)

[!INCLUDE[validation](../../includes/RP-EF/intro.md)]

In this tutorial, sorting, filtering, grouping, and paging, functionality is added.

The following illustration shows a completed page. The column headings are clickable links to sort the column. Clicking a column heading repeatedly switches between ascending and descending sort order.

## Add sorting to the Index page

Update the *Students/Index.cshtml.cs* `OnGetAsync` with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortOnly)]

The preceding code receives a `sortOrder` parameter from the query string in the URL. The URL (including the query string) is generated by the [Anchor Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/anchor-tag-helper
)

The `sortOrder` parameter is either "Name" or "Date." The `sortOrder` parameter is optionally followed by "_desc" to specify descending order. The default sort order is ascending.

When the Index page is requested from the **Students** link, there's no query string. The students are displayed in ascending order by last name. Ascending order by last name is the default (fall-through case) in the `switch` statement. When the user clicks a column heading link, the appropriate `sortOrder` value is provided in the query string value.

The two `ViewData` elements (`NameSort` and `DateSort`) are used by the Razor Page to configure the column heading hyperlinks with the appropriate query string values:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortOnly&highlight=3-4)]

`ViewData` is a [ViewDataDictionary](/aspnet/core/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.viewfeatures.viewdatadictionary) object accessed through `string` keys. `ViewData` provides a convenient way to pass data from a Razor Page to a code-behind file, and from a code-behind file to a Razor Page. For more information, see [Weakly typed data (ViewData and ViewBag)](xref:mvc/views/overview#VD_VB) and [ViewData](xref:mvc/views/overview#VD).

The following code contains the C# [?: operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-operator):

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_Ternary)]

 The first line specifies that when `sortOrder` is null or empty, `NameSort` is set to "name_desc." If `sortOrder` is **not** null or empty, `NameSort` is set to an empty string.

The `?: operator` is also known as the ternary operator.

These two statements enable the view to set the column heading hyperlinks as follows:

| Current sort order | Last Name Hyperlink | Date Hyperlink |
|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------:|
| Last Name ascending | descending        | ascending      |
| Last Name descending | ascending           | ascending      |
| Date ascending       | ascending           | descending     |
| Date descending      | ascending           | ascending      |

The method uses LINQ to Entities to specify the column to sort by. The code initializes an `IQueryable<Student> ` before the switch statement, and modifies it in the switch statement:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortOnly&highlight=6-)]

 When an`IQueryable` is created or modified, no query is sent to the database. The query is not executed until the `IQueryable` object is converted into a collection. `IQueryable` are converted to a collection by calling a method such as `ToListAsync`. Therefore, the `IQueryable` code results in a single query that is not executed until the following statement:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortOnlyRtn)]

`OnGetAsync` could get verbose with a large number of columns. [The last tutorial in this series](xref:data/ef-mvc/advanced#dynamic-linq) shows how to write code that passes the name of the `OrderBy` column in a string variable.

### Add column heading hyperlinks to the Student Index view

Replace the code in *Students/Index.cshtml*, with the following highlighted code:

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index2.cshtml?highlight=17-19,25-27)]

The preceding code:

* Adds hyperlinks to the `LastName` and `EnrollmentDate` column headings.
* Uses the information in `ViewData` dictionary to set up hyperlinks with the current sort order values.

To verify that sorting works:

* Run the app and select the **Students** tab.
* Click **Last Name**.
* Click **Enrollment Date**.

To get a better understanding of the code:

* In *Student/Index.cshtml.cs*, set a breakpoint on `switch (sortOrder)`.
* Add a watch for `ViewData["NameSort"]` and `ViewData["DateSort"]`.
* In *Student/Index.cshtml*, set a breakpoint on `@Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Student[0].LastName)`.

Step through the debugger.

## Add a Search Box to the Students Index page

To add filtering to the Students Index page:

* A text box and a submit button is added to the Razor Page. The text box supplies a search string on the first or last name.
* The code-behind file is updated to use the text box value.

### Add filtering functionality to the Index method

Update the *Students/Index.cshtml.cs* `OnGetAsync` with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortFilter&highlight=1,5,9-13)]

The preceding code:

* Adds the `searchString` parameter to the `OnGetAsync` method. The search string value is received from a text box that is added in the next section.
* Added to the LINQ statement a `Where` clause. The `Where` clause selects only students whose first name or last name contains the search string. The LINQ statement is executed only if there's a value to search for.

Note: The preceding code calls the `Where` method on an `IQueryable` object, and the filter is processed on the server. In some scenarios, tha app might be calling the `Where` method as an extension method on an in-memory collection. For example, suppose `_context.Students` changes from EF `DbSet` to a repository method that returns an `IEnumerable` collection. The result would normally be the same but in some cases may be different.

For example, the .NET Framework implementation of `Contains` performs a case-sensitive comparison by default. In SQL Server, `Contains` case-sensitivity is determined by the collation setting of the SQL Server instance. SQL Serve defaults to case-insensitive. `ToUpper` could be called to make the test explicitly case-insensitive:

`Where(s => s.LastName.ToUpper().Contains(searchString.ToUpper())`

The preceding code would ensure that results are case-insensitive if the code changes to use `IEnumerable`. When `Contains` is called on an `IEnumerable` collection, the .NET Core implementation is used. When `Contains` is called on an `IQueryable` object, the database implementation is used. Returning an `IEnumerable` can have a significant performance penality:

1. All the rows are returned from the DB server.
1. The filter is applied to all the returned rows in the application.

There is a performance penalty for calling `ToUpper`. The `ToUpper` code adds a function in the WHERE clause of the TSQL SELECT statement. The added function prevents the optimizer from using an index. Given that SQL is installed as case-insensitive, it's best to avoid the `ToUpper` call when it's not needed.

### Add a Search Box to the Student Index View

In *Views/Student/Index.cshtml*, add the following highlighted code to create a **Search** button and assorted chrome.

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index3.cshtml?highlight=14-23&range=1-25)]

The preceding code uses the `<form>` [tag helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro) to add the search text box and button. By default, the `<form>` tag helper submits form data with a POST. With POST, the parameters are passed in the HTTP message body and not in the URL. When HTTP GET is used, the form data is passed in the URL as query strings. Passing the data with query strings enables users to bookmark the URL. The [W3C guidelines](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html) recommend that GET should be used when the action does not result in an update.

Test the app:

* Select the **Students** tab and enter a search string.
* Select **Search**.

Notice that the URL contains the search string.

```html
http://localhost:5000/Students?SearchString=an
```

If the page is bookmarked, the bookmark contains the URL to the page and the `SearchString` query string. The `method="get"` in the `form` tag is what caused the query string to be generated.

Currently, when a column heading sort link is selected, the filter value from the **Search** box is lost. The lost filter value is fixed in the next section.

## Add paging functionality to the Students Index page

In this section, a `PaginatedList` class is created to support paging. The `PaginatedList` class uses `Skip` and `Take` statements to filter data on the server instead of retrieving all rows of the table. The following illustration shows the paging buttons.

![Students index page with paging links](sort-filter-page/_static/paging.png)

In the project folder, create `PaginatedList.cs` with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/PaginatedList.cs)]

The `CreateAsync` method in the preceding code takes page size and page number and applies the appropriate `Skip` and `Take` statements to the `IQueryable`. When `ToListAsync` is called on the `IQueryable`, it returns a List containing only the requested page. The properties `HasPreviousPage` and `HasNextPage` are used to enable or disable **Previous** and **Next** paging buttons.

The `CreateAsync` method is used to create the `PaginatedList<T>`. A constructor can't create the `PaginatedList<T>` object, constructors can't run asynchronous code.

## Add paging functionality to the Index method

In *Students/Index.cshtml.cs*, update the type of `Student` from `IList<Student>` to `PaginatedList<Student>`:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortFilterPageType)]

Update the *Students/Index.cshtml.cs* `OnGetAsync` with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortFilterPage&highlight=1-4,7-14,41-)]

The preceding code adds the page index, the current `sortOrder`, and the `currentFilter` to the method signature.

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortFilterPage2)]

All the parameters are null when:

* The page is called from the **Students** link.
* The user hasn't clicked a paging or sorting link.

When a paging link is clicked, the page index variable contains the page number to display.

`ViewData["CurrentSort"]` provides the Razor Page with the current sort order. The current sort order must be included in the paging links to keep the sort order while paging.

`ViewData["CurrentFilter"]` provides the Razor Page with the current filter string. The `ViewData["CurrentFilter"]` value:

* Must be included in the paging links in order to maintain the filter settings during paging.
* Must be restored to the text box when the page is redisplayed.

If the search string is changed while paging, the page is reset to 1. The page has to be reset to 1 because the new filter can result in different data to display. When a search value is entered and **Submit** is selected:

* The search string is changed.
* The `searchString` parameter is not null.

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortFilterPage3)]

The `PaginatedList.CreateAsync` method converts the student query to a single page of students in a collection type that supports paging. That single page of students is passed to the Razor Page.

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_SortFilterPage4)]

The two question marks in `PaginatedList.CreateAsync` represent the [null-coalescing operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/ dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-conditional-operator). The null-coalescing operator defines a default value for a nullable type. The expression `(pageIndex ?? 1)` means return the value of `pageIndex` if it has a value. If `pageIndex` doesn't have a value, return 1.

## Add paging links to the student Razor Page

Update the markup in *Students/Index.cshtml*. The changes are highlighted:

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml?highlight=28-31,37-40,68-)]

The column header links use the query string to pass the current search string to the `OnGetAsync` method so that the user can sort within filter results:

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml?range=28-31)]

The paging buttons are displayed by tag helpers:

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml?range=72-)]

Run the app and navigate to the students page.

* To make sure paging works, click the paging links in different sort orders.
* To verify that paging works correctly with sorting and filtering, enter a search string and try paging.

![students index page with paging links](sort-filter-page/_static/paging.png)

To get a better understanding of the code:

* In *Student/Index.cshtml.cs*, set a breakpoint on `switch (sortOrder)`.
* Add a watch for `ViewData["NameSort"]`, `ViewData["DateSort"]`, ViewData["CurrentSort"], and `Model.Student.PageIndex`.
* In *Student/Index.cshtml*, set a breakpoint on `@Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Student[0].LastName)`.

Step through the debugger.

## Update the About page to show student statistics

In this step, *Pages/About.cshtml* is updated to display how many students have enrolled for each enrollment date. The update uses grouping, and includes the following steps:

* Create a view model class for the data used by the **About** Page.
* Modify the About Razor Page and code-behind file.

### Create the view model

Create a *SchoolViewModels* folder in the *Models* folder.

In the *SchoolViewModels* folder, add a *EnrollmentDateGroup.cs* with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Models/SchoolViewModels/EnrollmentDateGroup.cs)]

### Update the About code-behind page

Update the *Pages/About.cshtml.cs* file with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/About.cshtml.cs)]

The LINQ statement groups the student entities by enrollment date, calculates the number of entities in each group, and stores the results in a collection of `EnrollmentDateGroup` view model objects.

Note: The LINQ `group` command isn't currently supported by EF Core. In the preceding code, all the student records are returned from SQL Server. The `group` command is applied in the Razor Pages app, not on the SQL Server. EF Core 2.1 will support this LINQ `group` operator, and the grouping occurs on the SQL Server. See [Relational: Support translating GroupBy() to SQL](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/2341). [EF Core 2.1](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/wiki/roadmap) will be released with .NET Core 2.1. For more information, see the [.NET Core Roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md).

### Modify the About Razor Page

Replace the code in the *Views/Home/About.cshtml* file with the following code:

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu/Pages/About.cshtml)]

Run the app and navigate to the About page. The count of students for each enrollment date is displayed in a table.
