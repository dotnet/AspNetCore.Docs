# Contoso University sample app

Contoso University demonstrates how to use Entity Framework Core in an
ASP.NET Core MVC web application.

## Build it from scratch

You can build the application by following the steps in [a series of tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro).

## Download it

Download the [completed project](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/data/ef-mvc/intro/samples/cu-final) from GitHub by downloading or cloning the [aspnet/Docs repository](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs) and navigating to `aspnetcore\data\ef-mvc\intro\samples\cu-final` in your local file system.  After downloading the project, create the database by entering `dotnet ef database update` at a command-line prompt. As an alternative you can use **Package Manager Console** -- for more information, see [Command-line interface (CLI) vs. Package Manager Console (PMC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/migrations#command-line-interface-cli-vs-package-manager-console-pmc).
