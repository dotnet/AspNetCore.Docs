# Host and deploy ASP.NET Core Blazor

This article explains how to host and deploy Blazor apps.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

## Publish the app

Apps are published for deployment in Release configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Publish a hosted Blazor WebAssembly [solution](xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln) from the **`Server`** project.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

1. Select **Build** > **Publish {APPLICATION}** from the navigation bar.
1. Select the *publish target*. To publish locally, select **Folder**.
1. Accept the default location in the **Choose a folder** field or specify a different location. Select the **`Publish`** button.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-mac)

1. Select **Build** > **Publish to Folder**.
1. Confirm the folder to receive the published assets and select **`Publish`**.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

Use the [`dotnet publish`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) command to publish the app with a Release configuration:

```dotnetcli
dotnet publish -c Release
```

---

Publishing the app triggers a [restore](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore) of the project's dependencies and [builds](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) the project before creating the assets for deployment. As part of the build process, unused methods and assemblies are removed to reduce app download size and load times.

Publish locations:

* Blazor WebAssembly
  * Standalone: The app is published into the `/bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish/wwwroot` folder. To deploy the app as a static site, copy the contents of the `wwwroot` folder to the static site host.
  * Hosted: The client Blazor WebAssembly app is published into the `/bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish/wwwroot` folder of the server app, along with any other static web assets of the server app. Deploy the contents of the `publish` folder to the host.
* Blazor Server: The app is published into the `/bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish` folder. Deploy the contents of the `publish` folder to the host.

The assets in the folder are deployed to the web server. Deployment might be a manual or automated process depending on the development tools in use.

## IIS Application Pools

Sharing an app pool among ASP.NET Core apps isn't supported, including for Blazor apps. Use one app pool per app when hosting with IIS, and avoid the use of IIS's [virtual directories](/iis/get-started/planning-your-iis-architecture/understanding-sites-applications-and-virtual-directories-on-iis#virtual-directories) for hosting multiple apps.

One or more Blazor WebAssembly apps hosted by an ASP.NET Core app, known as a [hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution](xref:blazor/hosting-models#blazor-webassembly), are supported for ***one*** app pool. However, we don't recommend or support assigning a single app pool to multiple hosted Blazor WebAssembly solutions or in sub-app hosting scenarios. For more information, see <xref:host-and-deploy/iis/advanced#sub-applications>.

For more information on *solutions*, see <xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln>.

## App base path

The *app base path* is the app's root URL path. Consider the following ASP.NET Core app and Blazor sub-app:

* The ASP.NET Core app is named `MyApp`:
  * The app physically resides at `d:/MyApp`.
  * Requests are received at `https://www.contoso.com/{MYAPP RESOURCE}`.
* A Blazor app named `CoolApp` is a sub-app of `MyApp`:
  * The sub-app physically resides at `d:/MyApp/CoolApp`.
  * Requests are received at `https://www.contoso.com/CoolApp/{COOLAPP RESOURCE}`.

Without specifying additional configuration for `CoolApp`, the sub-app in this scenario has no knowledge of where it resides on the server. For example, the app can't construct correct relative URLs to its resources without knowing that it resides at the relative URL path `/CoolApp/`. This scenario also applies in various hosting and reverse proxy scenarios when an app isn't hosted at a root URL path.

To provide configuration for the Blazor app's base path of `https://www.contoso.com/CoolApp/`, set the relative root path.

By configuring the relative URL path for an app, a component that isn't in the root directory can construct URLs relative to the app's root path. Components at different levels of the directory structure can build links to other resources at locations throughout the app. The app base path is also used to intercept selected hyperlinks where the `href` target of the link is within the app base path URI space. The Blazor router handles the internal navigation.

In many hosting scenarios, the relative URL path to the app is the root of the app. In these default cases, the app's relative URL base path is the following:

* Blazor WebAssembly: `/` configured as `<base href="/" />`.
* Blazor Server: `~/` configured as `<base href="~/" />`.

For the location of `<head>` content in Blazor apps, see <xref:blazor/project-structure#location-of-head-content>.

In other hosting scenarios, such as GitHub Pages and IIS sub-apps, the app base path must be set to the server's relative URL path of the app.

* Standalone Blazor WebAssembly:

  `wwwroot/index.html`:

  ```html
  <base href="/CoolApp/">
  ```

  **The trailing slash is required.**

* Hosted Blazor WebAssembly:

  In the **`Client`** project, `wwwroot/index.html`:

  ```html
  <base href="/CoolApp/">
  ```

  **The trailing slash is required.**

  In the **`Server`** project, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.UsePathBaseExtensions.UsePathBase%2A> ***early*** in the app's request processing pipeline (`Program.cs`) to configure the base path for any following middleware that interacts with the request path:

  ```csharp
  app.UsePathBase("/CoolApp");
  // ...
  app.UseRouting();
  ```

* In a Blazor Server app, use ***either*** of the following approaches:

  * Option 1: Use the `<base>` tag to set the app's base path ([location of `<head>` content](xref:blazor/project-structure#location-of-head-content)):

    ```html
    <base href="/CoolApp/">
    ```

    **The trailing slash is required.**

  * Option 2: Call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.UsePathBaseExtensions.UsePathBase%2A> ***early*** in the app's request processing pipeline (`Program.cs`) to configure the base path for any following middleware that interacts with the request path:

    ```csharp
    app.UsePathBase("/CoolApp");
    // ...
    app.UseRouting();
    ```

    Calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.UsePathBaseExtensions.UsePathBase%2A> is recommended when you also wish to run the Blazor Server app locally. For example, supply the launch URL in `Properties/launchSettings.json`:
  
    ```xml
    "launchUrl": "https://localhost:{PORT}/CoolApp",
    ```

    The `{PORT}` placeholder in the preceding example is the port that matches the secure port in the `applicationUrl` configuration path. The following example shows the full launch profile for an app at port 7279:
  
    ```xml
    "BlazorSample": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7279;http://localhost:5279",
      "launchUrl": "https://localhost:7279/CoolApp",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
    }
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> When using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication> (see <xref:migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model>), [`app.UseRouting`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.EndpointRoutingApplicationBuilderExtensions.UseRouting%2A) must be called after `UsePathBase` so that the routing middleware can observe the modified path before matching routes. Otherwise, routes are matched before the path is rewritten by `UsePathBase` as described in the [Middleware Ordering](xref:fundamentals/middleware/index#order) and [Routing](xref:fundamentals/routing) articles.

Do ***not*** prefix links throughout the app with a forward slash. Either avoid the use of a path segment separator or use dot-slash (`./`) relative path notation:

* ❌ Incorrect: `<a href="/account">`
* ✔️ Correct: `<a href="account">`
* ✔️ Correct: `<a href="./account">`

In [Blazor WebAssembly web API requests with the `HttpClient` service](xref:blazor/call-web-api?pivots=webassembly), confirm that JSON helpers (<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions>) do ***not*** prefix URLs with a forward slash (`/`):

* ❌ Incorrect: `var rsp = await client.GetFromJsonAsync("/api/Account");`
* ✔️ Correct: `var rsp = await client.GetFromJsonAsync("api/Account");`

Do ***not*** prefix [Navigation Manager](xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing#uri-and-navigation-state-helpers) relative links with a forward slash. Either avoid the use of a path segment separator or use dot-slash (`./`) relative path notation:

* ❌ Incorrect: `NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/other");`
* ✔️ Correct: `NavigationManager.NavigateTo("other");`
* ✔️ Correct: `NavigationManager.NavigateTo("./other");`

In typical configurations for Azure/IIS hosting, additional configuration usually isn't required. In some non-IIS hosting and reverse proxy hosting scenarios, additional Static File Middleware configuration might be required to serve static files correctly (for example, `app.UseStaticFiles("/CoolApp");`). The required configuration might require further configuration to serve the Blazor script (`_framework/blazor.server.js` or `_framework/blazor.webassembly.js`). For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/static-files>.

For a Blazor WebAssembly app with a non-root relative URL path (for example, `<base href="/CoolApp/">`), the app fails to find its resources *when run locally*. To overcome this problem during local development and testing, you can supply a *path base* argument that matches the `href` value of the `<base>` tag at runtime. **Don't include a trailing slash.** To pass the path base argument when running the app locally, execute the `dotnet run` command from the app's directory with the `--pathbase` option:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --pathbase=/{RELATIVE URL PATH (no trailing slash)}
```

For a Blazor WebAssembly app with a relative URL path of `/CoolApp/` (`<base href="/CoolApp/">`), the command is:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --pathbase=/CoolApp
```

If you prefer to configure the app's launch profile to specify the `pathbase` automatically instead of manually with `dotnet run`, set the `commandLineArgs` property in `Properties/launchSettings.json`. The following also configures the launch URL (`launchUrl`):

```json
"commandLineArgs": "--pathbase=/{RELATIVE URL PATH (no trailing slash)}",
"launchUrl": "{RELATIVE URL PATH (no trailing slash)}",
```

Using `CoolApp` as the example:

```json
"commandLineArgs": "--pathbase=/CoolApp",
"launchUrl": "CoolApp",
```

Using either `dotnet run` with the `--pathbase` option or a launch profile configuration that sets the base path, the Blazor WebAssembly app responds locally at `http://localhost:port/CoolApp`.

## Blazor Server `MapFallbackToPage` configuration

In scenarios where an app requires a separate area with custom resources and Razor components:

* Create a folder within the app's `Pages` folder to hold the resources. For example, an administrator section of an app is created in a new folder named `Admin` (`Pages/Admin`).
* Create a root page (`_Host.cshtml`) for the area. For example, create a `Pages/Admin/_Host.cshtml` file from the app's main root page (`Pages/_Host.cshtml`). Don't provide an `@page` directive in the Admin `_Host` page.
* Add a layout to the area's folder (for example, `Pages/Admin/_Layout.razor`). In the layout for the separate area, set the `<base>` tag `href` to match the area's folder (for example, `<base href="/Admin/" />`). For demonstration purposes, add `~/` to the static resources in the page. For example:
  * `~/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css`
  * `~/css/site.css`
  * `~/BlazorSample.styles.css` (the example app's namespace is `BlazorSample`)
  * `~/_framework/blazor.server.js` (Blazor script)
* If the area should have its own static asset folder, add the folder and specify its location to Static File Middleware in `Program.cs` (for example, `app.UseStaticFiles("/Admin/wwwroot")`).
* Razor components are added to the area's folder. At a minimum, add an `Index` component to the area folder with the correct `@page` directive for the area. For example, add a `Pages/Admin/Index.razor` file based on the app's default `Pages/Index.razor` file. Indicate the Admin area as the route template at the top of the file (`@page "/admin"`). Add additional components as needed. For example, `Pages/Admin/Component1.razor` with an `@page` directive and route template of `@page "/admin/component1`.
* In `Program.cs`, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.RazorPagesEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapFallbackToPage%2A> for the area's request path immediately before the fallback root page path to the `_Host` page:

  ```csharp
  ...
  app.UseRouting();

  app.MapBlazorHub();
  app.MapFallbackToPage("~/Admin/{*clientroutes:nonfile}", "/Admin/_Host");
  app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");

  app.Run();
  ```

### Blazor Server `MapFallbackToPage` configuration

In scenarios where an app requires a separate area with custom resources and Razor components:

* Create a folder within the app's `Pages` folder to hold the resources. For example, an administrator section of an app is created in a new folder named `Admin` (`Pages/Admin`).
* Create a root page (`_Host.cshtml`) for the area. For example, create a `Pages/Admin/_Host.cshtml` file from the app's main root page (`Pages/_Host.cshtml`). Don't provide an `@page` directive in the Admin `_Host` page.
* Add a layout to the area's folder (for example, `Pages/Admin/_Layout.razor`). In the layout for the separate area, set the `<base>` tag `href` to match the area's folder (for example, `<base href="/Admin/" />`). For demonstration purposes, add `~/` to the static resources in the page. For example:
  * `~/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css`
  * `~/css/site.css`
  * `~/BlazorSample.styles.css` (the example app's namespace is `BlazorSample`)
  * `~/_framework/blazor.server.js` (Blazor script)
* If the area should have its own static asset folder, add the folder and specify its location to Static File Middleware in `Program.cs` (for example, `app.UseStaticFiles("/Admin/wwwroot")`).
* Razor components are added to the area's folder. At a minimum, add an `Index` component to the area folder with the correct `@page` directive for the area. For example, add a `Pages/Admin/Index.razor` file based on the app's default `Pages/Index.razor` file. Indicate the Admin area as the route template at the top of the file (`@page "/admin"`). Add additional components as needed. For example, `Pages/Admin/Component1.razor` with an `@page` directive and route template of `@page "/admin/component1`.
* In `Startup.Configure`, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.RazorPagesEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapFallbackToPage%2A> for the area's request path immediately before the fallback root page path to the `_Host` page:

  ```csharp
  ...
  app.UseRouting();

  app.MapBlazorHub();
  app.MapFallbackToPage("~/Admin/{*clientroutes:nonfile}", "/Admin/_Host");
  app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");

  app.Run();
  ```

## Publish the app

Apps are published for deployment in Release configuration.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

1. Select **Build** > **Publish {APPLICATION}** from the navigation bar.
1. Select the *publish target*. To publish locally, select **Folder**.
1. Accept the default location in the **Choose a folder** field or specify a different location. Select the **`Publish`** button.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-mac)

1. Select **Build** > **Publish to Folder**.
1. Confirm the folder to receive the published assets and select **`Publish`**.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

Use the [`dotnet publish`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) command to publish the app with a Release configuration:

```dotnetcli
dotnet publish -c Release
```

---

Publishing the app triggers a [restore](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore) of the project's dependencies and [builds](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) the project before creating the assets for deployment. As part of the build process, unused methods and assemblies are removed to reduce app download size and load times.

Publish locations:

* Blazor WebAssembly
  * Standalone: The app is published into the `/bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish/wwwroot` folder. To deploy the app as a static site, copy the contents of the `wwwroot` folder to the static site host.
  * Hosted: The client Blazor WebAssembly app is published into the `/bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish/wwwroot` folder of the server app, along with any other static web assets of the server app. Deploy the contents of the `publish` folder to the host.
* Blazor Server: The app is published into the `/bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish` folder. Deploy the contents of the `publish` folder to the host.

The assets in the folder are deployed to the web server. Deployment might be a manual or automated process depending on the development tools in use.

## IIS Application Pools

Sharing an app pool among ASP.NET Core apps isn't supported, including for Blazor apps. Use one app pool per app when hosting with IIS, and avoid the use of IIS's [virtual directories](/iis/get-started/planning-your-iis-architecture/understanding-sites-applications-and-virtual-directories-on-iis#virtual-directories) for hosting multiple apps.

One or more Blazor WebAssembly apps hosted by an ASP.NET Core app, known as a [hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution](xref:blazor/hosting-models#blazor-webassembly), are supported for ***one*** app pool. However, we don't recommend or support assigning a single app pool to multiple hosted Blazor WebAssembly solutions or in sub-app hosting scenarios. For more information, see <xref:host-and-deploy/iis/advanced#sub-applications>.

For more information on *solutions*, see <xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln>.

## App base path

The *app base path* is the app's root URL path. Consider the following ASP.NET Core app and Blazor sub-app:

* The ASP.NET Core app is named `MyApp`:
  * The app physically resides at `d:/MyApp`.
  * Requests are received at `https://www.contoso.com/{MYAPP RESOURCE}`.
* A Blazor app named `CoolApp` is a sub-app of `MyApp`:
  * The sub-app physically resides at `d:/MyApp/CoolApp`.
  * Requests are received at `https://www.contoso.com/CoolApp/{COOLAPP RESOURCE}`.

Without specifying additional configuration for `CoolApp`, the sub-app in this scenario has no knowledge of where it resides on the server. For example, the app can't construct correct relative URLs to its resources without knowing that it resides at the relative URL path `/CoolApp/`. This scenario also applies in various hosting and reverse proxy scenarios when an app isn't hosted at a root URL path.

To provide configuration for the Blazor app's base path of `https://www.contoso.com/CoolApp/`, set the relative root path.

By configuring the relative URL path for an app, a component that isn't in the root directory can construct URLs relative to the app's root path. Components at different levels of the directory structure can build links to other resources at locations throughout the app. The app base path is also used to intercept selected hyperlinks where the `href` target of the link is within the app base path URI space. The Blazor router handles the internal navigation.

In many hosting scenarios, the relative URL path to the app is the root of the app. In these default cases, the app's relative URL base path is the following:

* Blazor WebAssembly: `/` configured as `<base href="/" />` in `wwwroot/index.html`.
* Blazor Server: `~/` configured as `<base href="~/" />` in `Pages/_Host.cshtml`.

In other hosting scenarios, such as GitHub Pages and IIS sub-apps, the app base path must be set to the server's relative URL path of the app.

* Standalone Blazor WebAssembly:

  `wwwroot/index.html`:

  ```html
  <base href="/CoolApp/">
  ```

  **The trailing slash is required.**

* Hosted Blazor WebAssembly:

  In the **`Client`** project, `wwwroot/index.html`:

  ```html
  <base href="/CoolApp/">
  ```

  **The trailing slash is required.**

  In the **`Server`** project, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.UsePathBaseExtensions.UsePathBase%2A> ***early*** in the app's request processing pipeline (`Startup.cs`) to configure the base path for any following middleware that interacts with the request path:

  ```csharp
  app.UsePathBase("/CoolApp");
  ```

* In a Blazor Server app, use ***either*** of the following approaches:

  * Option 1: Use the `<base>` tag in `Pages/_Host.cshtml` to set the app's base path:

    ```html
    <base href="/CoolApp/">
    ```

    **The trailing slash is required.**

  * Option 2: Call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.UsePathBaseExtensions.UsePathBase%2A> ***early*** in the app's request processing pipeline (`Startup.cs`) to configure the base path for any following middleware that interacts with the request path:

    ```csharp
    app.UsePathBase("/CoolApp");
    ```

    Calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.UsePathBaseExtensions.UsePathBase%2A> is recommended when you also wish to run the Blazor Server app locally. For example, supply the launch URL in `Properties/launchSettings.json`:
  
    ```xml
    "launchUrl": "https://localhost:{PORT}/CoolApp",
    ```

    The `{PORT}` placeholder in the preceding example is the port that matches the secure port in the `applicationUrl` configuration path. The following example shows the full launch profile for an app at port 7279:
  
    ```xml
    "BlazorSample": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7279;http://localhost:5279",
      "launchUrl": "https://localhost:7279/CoolApp",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
    }
    ```

For a Blazor WebAssembly app with a non-root relative URL path (for example, `<base href="/CoolApp/">`), the app fails to find its resources *when run locally*. To overcome this problem during local development and testing, you can supply a *path base* argument that matches the `href` value of the `<base>` tag at runtime. **Don't include a trailing slash.** To pass the path base argument when running the app locally, execute the `dotnet run` command from the app's directory with the `--pathbase` option:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --pathbase=/{RELATIVE URL PATH (no trailing slash)}
```

For a Blazor WebAssembly app with a relative URL path of `/CoolApp/` (`<base href="/CoolApp/">`), the command is:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --pathbase=/CoolApp
```

If you prefer to configure the app's launch profile to specify the `pathbase` automatically instead of manually with `dotnet run`, set the `commandLineArgs` property in `Properties/launchSettings.json`. The following also configures the launch URL (`launchUrl`):

```json
"commandLineArgs": "--pathbase=/{RELATIVE URL PATH (no trailing slash)}",
"launchUrl": "{RELATIVE URL PATH (no trailing slash)}",
```

Using `CoolApp` as the example:

```json
"commandLineArgs": "--pathbase=/CoolApp",
"launchUrl": "CoolApp",
```

Using either `dotnet run` with the `--pathbase` option or a launch profile configuration that sets the base path, the Blazor WebAssembly app responds locally at `http://localhost:port/CoolApp`.

### Blazor Server `MapFallbackToPage` configuration

In scenarios where an app requires a separate area with custom resources and Razor components:

* Create a folder within the app's `Pages` folder to hold the resources. For example, an administrator section of an app is created in a new folder named `Admin` (`Pages/Admin`).
* Create a root page (`_Host.cshtml`) for the area. For example, create a `Pages/Admin/_Host.cshtml` file from the app's main root page (`Pages/_Host.cshtml`). Don't provide an `@page` directive in the Admin `_Host` page.
* Add a layout to the area's folder (for example, `Pages/Admin/_Layout.razor`). In the layout for the separate area, set the `<base>` tag `href` to match the area's folder (for example, `<base href="/Admin/" />`). For demonstration purposes, add `~/` to the static resources in the page. For example:
  * `~/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css`
  * `~/css/site.css`
  * `~/BlazorSample.styles.css` (the example app's namespace is `BlazorSample`)
  * `~/_framework/blazor.server.js` (Blazor script)
* If the area should have its own static asset folder, add the folder and specify its location to Static File Middleware in `Program.cs` (for example, `app.UseStaticFiles("/Admin/wwwroot")`).
* Razor components are added to the area's folder. At a minimum, add an `Index` component to the area folder with the correct `@page` directive for the area. For example, add a `Pages/Admin/Index.razor` file based on the app's default `Pages/Index.razor` file. Indicate the Admin area as the route template at the top of the file (`@page "/admin"`). Add additional components as needed. For example, `Pages/Admin/Component1.razor` with an `@page` directive and route template of `@page "/admin/component1`.
* In `Startup.Configure.cs`, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.RazorPagesEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapFallbackToPage%2A> for the area's request path immediately before the fallback root page path to the `_Host` page:

  ```csharp
  ...
  app.UseRouting();

  app.MapBlazorHub();
  app.MapFallbackToPage("~/Admin/{*clientroutes:nonfile}", "/Admin/_Host");
  app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");

  app.Run();
  ```
