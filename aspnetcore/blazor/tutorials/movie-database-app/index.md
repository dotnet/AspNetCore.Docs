# Build a Blazor movie database app (Overview)

<!-- UPDATE 9.0 Activate after release

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This tutorial explains the basics of building a Blazor Web App with a database, Entity Framework (EF) Core, and user interactivity.

Parts of this series include:

1. [Create a Blazor Web App](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-1)
1. [Add and scaffold a model](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-2)
1. [Learn about Razor components](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-3)
1. [Work with a database](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-4)
1. [Add validation](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-5)
1. [Add search](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-6)
1. [Add a new field](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-7)
1. [Add interactivity](xref:blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-8)

At the end of the tutorial, you'll have a Blazor Web App that can display and manage a movie database.

As you work through the tutorial (or if you're only reading the articles and not building the app), you can refer to the completed sample app in the [Blazor samples GitHub repository (`dotnet/blazor-samples`)](https://github.com/dotnet/blazor-samples). Select the latest version folder in the repository. The sample folder for this tutorial's project is named `BlazorWebAppMovies`.

To open a documentation GitHub issue for an article of the series, use the **Open a documentation issue** link at the bottom of the article. Using the link to create your issue adds important tracking metadata to the issue and automatically pings the author.
