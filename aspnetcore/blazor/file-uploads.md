# ASP.NET Core Blazor file uploads

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This article explains how to upload files in Blazor with the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component.

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/location-client-and-server-pre-net8.md)]

## File uploads

> [!WARNING]
> Always follow security best practices when permitting users to upload files. For more information, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

Use the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component to read browser file data into .NET code. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component renders an HTML `<input>` element of type `file`. By default, the user selects single files. Add the `multiple` attribute to permit the user to upload multiple files at once.

File selection isn't cumulative when using an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component or its underlying [HTML `<input type="file">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file), so you can't add files to an existing file selection. The component always replaces the user's initial file selection, so file references from prior selections aren't available.

The following <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component executes the `LoadFiles` method when the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile.OnChange> ([`change`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event)) event occurs. An <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFileChangeEventArgs> provides access to the selected file list and details about each file:

```razor
<InputFile OnChange="LoadFiles" multiple />

@code {
    private void LoadFiles(InputFileChangeEventArgs e)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Rendered HTML:

```html
<input multiple="" type="file" _bl_2="">
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the preceding example, the `<input>` element's `_bl_2` attribute is used for Blazor's internal processing.

To read data from a user-selected file, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.OpenReadStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the file and read from the returned stream. For more information, see the [File streams](#file-streams) section.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.OpenReadStream%2A> enforces a maximum size in bytes of its <xref:System.IO.Stream>. Reading one file or multiple files larger than 500 KB results in an exception. This limit prevents developers from accidentally reading large files into memory. The `maxAllowedSize` parameter of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.OpenReadStream%2A> can be used to specify a larger size if required.

If you need access to a <xref:System.IO.Stream> that represents the file's bytes, use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.OpenReadStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Avoid reading the incoming file stream directly into memory all at once. For example, don't copy all of the file's bytes into a <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> or read the entire stream into a byte array all at once. These approaches can result in performance and security problems, especially for server-side components. Instead, consider adopting either of the following approaches:

* Copy the stream directly to a file on disk without reading it into memory. Note that Blazor apps executing code on the server aren't able to access the client's file system directly. 
* Upload files from the client directly to an external service. For more information, see the [Upload files to an external service](#upload-files-to-an-external-service) section.

In the following examples, `browserFile` represents the uploaded file and implements <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile>. Working implementations for <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile> are shown in the file upload components later in this article.

<span aria-hidden="true">❌</span><span class="visually-hidden">Unsupported:</span> The following approach is **NOT recommended** because the file's <xref:System.IO.Stream> content is read into a <xref:System.String> in memory (`reader`):

```csharp
var reader = 
    await new StreamReader(browserFile.OpenReadStream()).ReadToEndAsync();
```

<span aria-hidden="true">❌</span><span class="visually-hidden">Unsupported:</span> The following approach is **NOT recommended** for [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview) because the file's <xref:System.IO.Stream> content is copied into a <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> in memory (`memoryStream`) before calling <xref:Azure.Storage.Blobs.BlobContainerClient.UploadBlobAsync%2A>:

```csharp
var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
browserFile.OpenReadStream().CopyToAsync(memoryStream);
await blobContainerClient.UploadBlobAsync(
    trustedFileName, memoryStream));
```

<span aria-hidden="true">✔️</span><span class="visually-hidden">Supported:</span> The following approach is **recommended** because the file's <xref:System.IO.Stream> is provided directly to the consumer, a <xref:System.IO.FileStream> that creates the file at the provided path:

```csharp
await using FileStream fs = new(path, FileMode.Create);
await browserFile.OpenReadStream().CopyToAsync(fs);
```

<span aria-hidden="true">✔️</span><span class="visually-hidden">Supported:</span> The following approach is **recommended** for [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview) because the file's <xref:System.IO.Stream> is provided directly to <xref:Azure.Storage.Blobs.BlobContainerClient.UploadBlobAsync%2A>:

```csharp
await blobContainerClient.UploadBlobAsync(
    trustedFileName, browserFile.OpenReadStream());
```

A component that receives an image file can call the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.BrowserFileExtensions.RequestImageFileAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> convenience method on the file to resize the image data within the browser's JavaScript runtime before the image is streamed into the app. Use cases for calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.BrowserFileExtensions.RequestImageFileAsync%2A> are most appropriate for Blazor WebAssembly apps.

## File size read and upload limits

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

Server-side or client-side, there's no file read or upload size limit specifically for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component. However, client-side Blazor reads the file's bytes into a single JavaScript array buffer when marshalling the data from JavaScript to C#, which is limited to 2 GB or to the device's available memory. Large file uploads (> 250 MB) may fail for client-side uploads using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component. For more information, see the following discussions:

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-6.0"

The maximum supported file size for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component is 2 GB. Additionally, client-side Blazor reads the file's bytes into a single JavaScript array buffer when marshalling the data from JavaScript to C#, which is limited to 2 GB or to the device's available memory. Large file uploads (> 250 MB) may fail for client-side uploads using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component. For more information, see the following discussions:

:::moniker-end

* [The Blazor InputFile Component should handle chunking when the file is uploaded (dotnet/runtime #84685)](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/84685)
* [Request Streaming upload via http handler (dotnet/runtime #36634)](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36634)

For large client-side file uploads that fail when attempting to use the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component, we recommend chunking large files with a custom component using multiple [HTTP range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) instead of using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component.

<!-- UPDATE 9.0 PU PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/91295 -->

Work is currently scheduled for .NET 9 (late 2024) to address the client-side file size upload limitation.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate multiple file upload in a component. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFileChangeEventArgs.GetMultipleFiles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> allows reading multiple files. Specify the maximum number of files to prevent a malicious user from uploading a larger number of files than the app expects. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFileChangeEventArgs.File?displayProperty=nameWithType> allows reading the first and only file if the file upload doesn't support multiple files.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFileChangeEventArgs> is in the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms?displayProperty=fullName> namespace, which is typically one of the namespaces in the app's `_Imports.razor` file. When the namespace is present in the `_Imports.razor` file, it provides API member access to the app's components.

Namespaces in the `_Imports.razor` file aren't applied to C# files (`.cs`). C# files require an explicit [`using`](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/namespaces#using-directives) directive at the top of the class file:

```razor
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms;
```

For testing file upload components, you can create test files of any size with [PowerShell](/powershell/):

```powershell
$out = new-object byte[] {SIZE}; (new-object Random).NextBytes($out); [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes('{PATH}', $out)
```

In the preceding command:

* The `{SIZE}` placeholder is the size of the file in bytes (for example, `2097152` for a 2 MB file).
* The `{PATH}` placeholder is the path and file with file extension (for example, `D:/test_files/testfile2MB.txt`).

### Server-side file upload example

**To use the following code, create a `Development/unsafe_uploads` folder at the root of the app running in the `Development` environment.**

Because the example uses the app's [environment](xref:blazor/fundamentals/environments) as part of the path where files are saved, additional folders are required if other environments are used in testing and production. For example, create a `Staging/unsafe_uploads` folder for the `Staging` environment. Create a `Production/unsafe_uploads` folder for the `Production` environment.

> [!WARNING]
> The example saves files without scanning their contents, and the guidance in this article doesn't take into account additional security best practices for uploaded files. On staging and production systems, disable execute permission on the upload folder and scan files with an anti-virus/anti-malware scanner API immediately after upload. For more information, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

### Client-side file upload example

The following example processes file bytes and doesn't send files to a destination outside of the app. For an example of a Razor component that sends a file to a server or service, see the following sections:

* [Upload files to a server](#upload-files-to-a-server)
* [Upload files to an external service](#upload-files-to-an-external-service)

The component assumes that the Interactive WebAssembly render mode (`InteractiveWebAssembly`) is inherited from a parent component or applied globally to the app.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile> returns metadata [exposed by the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File#Instance_properties) as properties. Use this metadata for preliminary validation.

* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.Name>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.Size>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.LastModified>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.ContentType>

***Never trust the values of the preceding properties, especially the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.Name> property for display in the UI.*** Treat all user-supplied data as a significant security risk to the app, server, and network. For more information, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

## Upload files to a server with server-side rendering

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

*This section applies to Interactive Server components in Blazor Web Apps.*

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-8.0"

*This section applies to Blazor Server apps.*

:::moniker-end

The following example demonstrates uploading files from a server-side app to a backend web API controller in a separate app, possibly on a separate server.

In the server-side app's `Program` file, add <xref:System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory> and related services that allow the app to create <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instances:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
```

For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/http-requests>.

For the examples in this section:

* The web API runs at the URL: `https://localhost:5001`
* The server-side app runs at the URL: `https://localhost:5003`

For testing, the preceding URLs are configured in the projects' `Properties/launchSettings.json` files.

The following `UploadResult` class maintains the result of an uploaded file. When a file fails to upload on the server, an error code is returned in `ErrorCode` for display to the user. A safe file name is generated on the server for each file and returned to the client in `StoredFileName` for display. Files are keyed between the client and server using the unsafe/untrusted file name in `FileName`.

`UploadResult.cs`:

```csharp
public class UploadResult
{
    public bool Uploaded { get; set; }
    public string? FileName { get; set; }
    public string? StoredFileName { get; set; }
    public int ErrorCode { get; set; }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> A security best practice for production apps is to avoid sending error messages to clients that might reveal sensitive information about an app, server, or network. Providing detailed error messages can aid a malicious user in devising attacks on an app, server, or network. The example code in this section only sends back an error code number (`int`) for display by the component client-side if a server-side error occurs. If a user requires assistance with a file upload, they provide the error code to support personnel for support ticket resolution without ever knowing the exact cause of the error.

The following `FileUpload2` component:

* Permits users to upload files from the client.
* Displays the untrusted/unsafe file name provided by the client in the UI. The untrusted/unsafe file name is automatically HTML-encoded by Razor for safe display in the UI.

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't trust file names supplied by clients** for:
>
> * Saving the file to a file system or service.
> * Display in UIs that don't encode file names automatically or via developer code.
>
> For more information on security considerations when uploading files to a server, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

The following controller in the web API project saves uploaded files from the client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The controller in this section is intended for use in a separate web API project from the Blazor app. The web API should [mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks](xref:security/anti-request-forgery) if file upload users are authenticated.

:::moniker range="= aspnetcore-6.0"

> [!NOTE]
> Binding form values with the [`[FromForm]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.FromFormAttribute) isn't natively supported for [Minimal APIs](xref:fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0#explicit-parameter-binding) in ASP.NET Core 6.0. Therefore, the following `Filesave` controller example can't be converted to use Minimal APIs. Support for binding from form values with Minimal APIs is available in ASP.NET Core 7.0 or later.

:::moniker-end

**To use the following code, create a `Development/unsafe_uploads` folder at the root of the web API project for the app running in the `Development` environment.**

Because the example uses the app's [environment](xref:blazor/fundamentals/environments) as part of the path where files are saved, additional folders are required if other environments are used in testing and production. For example, create a `Staging/unsafe_uploads` folder for the `Staging` environment. Create a `Production/unsafe_uploads` folder for the `Production` environment.

> [!WARNING]
> The example saves files without scanning their contents, and the guidance in this article doesn't take into account additional security best practices for uploaded files. On staging and production systems, disable execute permission on the upload folder and scan files with an anti-virus/anti-malware scanner API immediately after upload. For more information, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

`Controllers/FilesaveController.cs`:

```csharp
using System.Net;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class FilesaveController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IHostEnvironment env;
    private readonly ILogger<FilesaveController> logger;

    public FilesaveController(IHostEnvironment env, 
        ILogger<FilesaveController> logger)
    {
        this.env = env;
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<ActionResult<IList<UploadResult>>> PostFile(
        [FromForm] IEnumerable<IFormFile> files)

            string trustedFileNameForFileStorage;
            var untrustedFileName = file.FileName;
            uploadResult.FileName = untrustedFileName;
            var trustedFileNameForDisplay =
                WebUtility.HtmlEncode(untrustedFileName);

            if (filesProcessed < maxAllowedFiles)
            {
                if (file.Length == 0)
                {
                    logger.LogInformation("{FileName} length is 0 (Err: 1)",
                        trustedFileNameForDisplay);
                    uploadResult.ErrorCode = 1;
                }
                else if (file.Length > maxFileSize)
                {
                    logger.LogInformation("{FileName} of {Length} bytes is " +
                        "larger than the limit of {Limit} bytes (Err: 2)",
                        trustedFileNameForDisplay, file.Length, maxFileSize);
                    uploadResult.ErrorCode = 2;
                }
                else
                {
                    try
                    {
                        trustedFileNameForFileStorage = Path.GetRandomFileName();
                        var path = Path.Combine(env.ContentRootPath,
                            env.EnvironmentName, "unsafe_uploads",
                            trustedFileNameForFileStorage);

                        await using FileStream fs = new(path, FileMode.Create);
                        await file.CopyToAsync(fs);

                        logger.LogInformation("{FileName} saved at {Path}",
                            trustedFileNameForDisplay, path);
                        uploadResult.Uploaded = true;
                        uploadResult.StoredFileName = trustedFileNameForFileStorage;
                    }
                    catch (IOException ex)
                    {
                        logger.LogError("{FileName} error on upload (Err: 3): {Message}",

        return new CreatedResult(resourcePath, uploadResults);
    }
}
```

In the preceding code, <xref:System.IO.Path.GetRandomFileName%2A> is called to generate a secure file name. Never trust the file name provided by the browser, as an attacker may choose an existing file name that overwrites an existing file or send a path that attempts to write outside of the app.

The server app must register controller services and map controller endpoints. For more information, see <xref:mvc/controllers/routing>.

## Upload files to a server

The following example demonstrates uploading files to a web API controller.

The following `UploadResult` class maintains the result of an uploaded file. When a file fails to upload on the server, an error code is returned in `ErrorCode` for display to the user. A safe file name is generated on the server for each file and returned to the client in `StoredFileName` for display. Files are keyed between the client and server using the unsafe/untrusted file name in `FileName`.

`UploadResult.cs`:

```csharp
public class UploadResult
{
    public bool Uploaded { get; set; }
    public string? FileName { get; set; }
    public string? StoredFileName { get; set; }
    public int ErrorCode { get; set; }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding `UploadResult` class can be shared between client- and server-based projects. When client and server projects share the class, add an import to each project's `_Imports.razor` file for the shared project. For example:
>
> ```razor
> @using BlazorSample.Shared
> ```

The following `FileUpload2` component:

* Permits users to upload files from the client.
* Displays the untrusted/unsafe file name provided by the client in the UI. The untrusted/unsafe file name is automatically HTML-encoded by Razor for safe display in the UI.

A security best practice for production apps is to avoid sending error messages to clients that might reveal sensitive information about an app, server, or network. Providing detailed error messages can aid a malicious user in devising attacks on an app, server, or network. The example code in this section only sends back an error code number (`int`) for display by the component client-side if a server-side error occurs. If a user requires assistance with a file upload, they provide the error code to support personnel for support ticket resolution without ever knowing the exact cause of the error.

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't trust file names supplied by clients** for:
>
> * Saving the file to a file system or service.
> * Display in UIs that don't encode file names automatically or via developer code.
>
> For more information on security considerations when uploading files to a server, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

In the Blazor Web App main project, add <xref:System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory> and related services in the project's `Program` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
```

The `HttpClient` services must be added to the main project because the client-side component is prerendered on the server. If you [disable prerendering for the following component](xref:blazor/components/render-modes#prerendering), you aren't required to provide the `HttpClient` services in the main app and don't need to add the preceding line to the main project.

For more information on adding `HttpClient` services to an ASP.NET Core app, see <xref:fundamentals/http-requests>.

The client project (`.Client`) of a Blazor Web App must also register an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> for HTTP POST requests to a backend web API controller. Confirm or add the following to the client project's `Program` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => 
    new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
```

The preceding example sets the base address with `builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress` (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>), which gets the base address for the app and is typically derived from the `<base>` tag's `href` value in the host page. If you're calling an external web API, set the URI to the web API's base address.

Specify the Interactive WebAssembly render mode attribute at the top of the following component in a Blazor Web App:

```razor
@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly
```

The following controller in the server-side project saves uploaded files from the client.

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-6.0"

> [!NOTE]
> Binding form values with the [`[FromForm]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.FromFormAttribute) isn't natively supported for [Minimal APIs](xref:fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0#explicit-parameter-binding) in ASP.NET Core 6.0. Therefore, the following `Filesave` controller example can't be converted to use Minimal APIs. Support for binding from form values with Minimal APIs is available in ASP.NET Core 7.0 or later.

**To use the following code, create a `Development/unsafe_uploads` folder at the root of the server-side project for the app running in the `Development` environment.**

Because the example uses the app's [environment](xref:blazor/fundamentals/environments) as part of the path where files are saved, additional folders are required if other environments are used in testing and production. For example, create a `Staging/unsafe_uploads` folder for the `Staging` environment. Create a `Production/unsafe_uploads` folder for the `Production` environment.

> [!WARNING]
> The example saves files without scanning their contents, and the guidance in this article doesn't take into account additional security best practices for uploaded files. On staging and production systems, disable execute permission on the upload folder and scan files with an anti-virus/anti-malware scanner API immediately after upload. For more information, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

In the following example, update the shared project's namespace to match the shared project if a shared project is supplying the `UploadResult` class.

In the preceding code, <xref:System.IO.Path.GetRandomFileName%2A> is called to generate a secure file name. Never trust the file name provided by the browser, as an attacker may choose an existing file name that overwrites an existing file or send a path that attempts to write outside of the app.

The server app must register controller services and map controller endpoints. For more information, see <xref:mvc/controllers/routing>.

## Cancel a file upload

A file upload component can detect when a user has cancelled an upload by using a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> when calling into the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.OpenReadStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

Create a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource> for the `InputFile` component. At the start of the `OnInputFileChange` method, check if a previous upload is in progress.

If a file upload is in progress:

* Call <xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource.Cancel%2A> on the previous upload.
* Create a new <xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource> for the next upload and pass the <xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource.Token?displayProperty=nameWithType> to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.IBrowserFile.OpenReadStream%2A> or <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadAsync%2A>.

## Upload files server-side with progress

The following example demonstrates how to upload files in a server-side app with upload progress displayed to the user.

To use the following example in a test app:

* **Create a folder to save uploaded files for the `Development` environment: `Development/unsafe_uploads`.**
* Configure the maximum file size (`maxFileSize`, 15 KB in the following example) and maximum number of allowed files (`maxAllowedFiles`, 3 in the following example).
* Set the buffer to a different value (10 KB in the following example), if desired, for increased granularity in progress reporting. We don't recommended using a buffer larger than 30 KB due to performance and security concerns.

> [!WARNING]
> The example saves files without scanning their contents, and the guidance in this article doesn't take into account additional security best practices for uploaded files. On staging and production systems, disable execute permission on the upload folder and scan files with an anti-virus/anti-malware scanner API immediately after upload. For more information, see <xref:mvc/models/file-uploads#security-considerations>.

For more information, see the following API resources:

* <xref:System.IO.FileStream>: Provides a <xref:System.IO.Stream> for a file, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous read and write operations.
* <xref:System.IO.FileStream.ReadAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>: The preceding `FileUpload3` component reads the stream asynchronously with <xref:System.IO.FileStream.ReadAsync%2A>. Reading a stream synchronously with <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Read%2A> isn't supported in Razor components.

## File streams

With server interactivity, file data is streamed over the SignalR connection into .NET code on the server as the file is read.

:::moniker range="= aspnetcore-5.0"

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.RemoteBrowserFileStreamOptions> allows configuring file upload characteristics.

:::moniker-end

For a WebAssembly-rendered component, file data is streamed directly into the .NET code within the browser.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

## Upload image preview

For an image preview of uploading images, start by adding an `InputFile` component with a component reference and an `OnChange` handler:

```razor
<InputFile @ref="inputFile" OnChange="ShowPreview" />
```

Add an image element with an [element reference](xref:blazor/js-interop/call-javascript-from-dotnet#capture-references-to-elements), which serves as the placeholder for the image preview:

```razor
<img @ref="previewImageElem" />
```

Add the associated references:

```razor
@code {
    private InputFile? inputFile;
    private ElementReference previewImageElem;
}
```

In JavaScript, add a function called with an HTML [`input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/) and [`img`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element that performs the following:

* Extracts the selected file.
* Creates an object URL with [`createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL).
* Sets an event listener to revoke the object URL with [`revokeObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL/revokeObjectURL) after the image is loaded, so memory isn't leaked.
* Sets the `img` element's source to display the image.

```javascript
window.previewImage = (inputElem, imgElem) => {
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(inputElem.files[0]);
  imgElem.addEventListener('load', () => URL.revokeObjectURL(url), { once: true });
  imgElem.src = url;
}
```

Finally, use an injected <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.IJSRuntime> to add the `OnChange` handler that calls the JavaScript function:

```razor
@inject IJSRuntime JS

...

@code {
    ...

    private async Task ShowPreview() => await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(
        "previewImage", inputFile!.Element, previewImageElem);
}
```

The preceding example is for uploading a single image. The approach can be expanded to support `multiple` images.

The following `FileUpload4` component shows the complete example.

`FileUpload4.razor`:

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

```razor
@page "/file-upload-4"
@inject IJSRuntime JS

<h1>File Upload Example</h1>

<InputFile @ref="inputFile" OnChange="ShowPreview" />

<img style="max-width:200px;max-height:200px" @ref="previewImageElem" />

@code {
    private InputFile? inputFile;
    private ElementReference previewImageElem;

    private async Task ShowPreview() => await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(
        "previewImage", inputFile!.Element, previewImageElem);
}
```

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0 < aspnetcore-8.0"

```razor
@page "/file-upload-4"
@inject IJSRuntime JS

<h1>File Upload Example</h1>

<InputFile @ref="inputFile" OnChange="ShowPreview" />

<img style="max-width:200px;max-height:200px" @ref="previewImageElem" />

@code {
    private InputFile? inputFile;
    private ElementReference previewImageElem;

    private async Task ShowPreview() => await JS.InvokeVoidAsync(
        "previewImage", inputFile!.Element, previewImageElem);
}
```

## Upload files to an external service

Instead of an app handling file upload bytes and the app's server receiving uploaded files, clients can directly upload files to an external service. The app can safely process the files from the external service on demand. This approach hardens the app and its server against malicious attacks and potential performance problems.

Consider an approach that uses [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/), [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/), or a third-party service with the following potential benefits:

* Upload files from the client directly to an external service with a JavaScript client library or REST API. For example, Azure offers the following client libraries and APIs:
  * [Azure Storage File Share client library](/javascript/api/overview/azure/storage-file-share-readme)
  * [Azure Files REST API](/rest/api/storageservices/file-service-rest-api)
  * [Azure Storage Blob client library for JavaScript](/javascript/api/overview/azure/storage-blob-readme)
  * [Blob service REST API](/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api)
* Authorize user uploads with a user-delegated shared-access signature (SAS) token generated by the app (server-side) for each client file upload. For example, Azure offers the following SAS features:
  * [Azure Storage File Share client library for JavaScript: with SAS Token](/javascript/api/overview/azure/storage-file-share-readme#with-sas-token)
  * [Azure Storage Blob client library for JavaScript: with SAS Token](/javascript/api/overview/azure/storage-blob-readme#with-sas-token)
* Provide automatic redundancy and file share backup.
* Limit uploads with quotas. Note that Azure Blob Storage's quotas are set at the account level, not the container level. However, Azure Files quotas are at the file share level and might provide better control over upload limits. For more information, see the Azure documents linked earlier in this list.
* Secure files with server-side encryption (SSE).

For more information on Azure Blob Storage and Azure Files, see the [Azure Storage documentation](/azure/storage/).

## Server-side SignalR message size limit

File uploads may fail even before they start, when Blazor retrieves data about the files that exceeds the maximum SignalR message size.

SignalR defines a message size limit that applies to every message Blazor receives, and the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms.InputFile> component streams files to the server in messages that respect the configured limit. However, the first message, which indicates the set of files to upload, is sent as a unique single message. The size of the first message may exceed the SignalR message size limit. The issue isn't related to the size of the files, it's related to the number of files.

The logged error is similar to the following:

> :::no-loc text="Error: Connection disconnected with error 'Error: Server returned an error on close: Connection closed with an error.'. e.log @ blazor.server.js:1":::

When uploading files, reaching the message size limit on the first message is rare. If the limit is reached, the app can configure <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.HubOptions.MaximumReceiveMessageSize?displayProperty=nameWithType> with a larger value.

For more information on SignalR configuration and how to set <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.HubOptions.MaximumReceiveMessageSize>, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/signalr#server-side-circuit-handler-options>.
