# Call a web API from ASP.NET Core Blazor

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This article describes how to call a web API from a Blazor app.

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/location-client-and-server-pre-net8.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The code examples in this article adopt [nullable reference types (NRTs) and .NET compiler null-state static analysis](xref:migration/50-to-60#nullable-reference-types-nrts-and-net-compiler-null-state-static-analysis), which are supported in ASP.NET Core 6.0 or later. When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, remove the null type designation (`?`) from the `string?`, `TodoItem[]?`, `WeatherForecast[]?`, and `IEnumerable<GitHubBranch>?` types in the article's examples.

> [!NOTE]
> This article has loaded **WebAssembly** client-side rendering (CSR) coverage for calling web APIs. The [coverage for **Server** interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR)](?pivots=server) addresses the following subjects:
>
> * Use of the `HttpClient` factory infrastructure to provide an `HttpClient` to the app.
> * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) pertaining to server-side components.
> * Blazor framework component examples for testing web API access.
> * Additional resources for developing Blazor Server apps that call a web API.

Client-side components call web APIs using a preconfigured <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> service, which is focused on making requests back to the server of origin. Additional <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> service configurations for other web APIs can be created in developer code. Requests are composed using Blazor JSON helpers or with <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage>. Requests can include [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) option configuration.

## Examples in this article

In this article's component examples, a hypothetical todo list web API is used to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todo items on a server. The examples are based on a `TodoItem` class that stores the following todo item data:

* ID (`Id`, `long`): Unique ID of the item.
* Name (`Name`, `string`): Name of the item.
* Status (`IsComplete`, `bool`): Indication if the todo item is finished.

Use the following `TodoItem` class with this article's examples if you build the examples into a test app:

```csharp
public class TodoItem
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsComplete { get; set; }
}
```

For guidance on how to create a server-side web API, see <xref:tutorials/first-web-api>. For information on Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), see the *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)* section later in this article.

For server-side components in Blazor Web Apps that require interactivity, add interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR) to the component:

```razor
@rendermode InteractiveServer
```

For client-side components in Blazor Web Apps that require interactivity, add Interactive WebAssembly rendering to the component:

```razor
@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly
```

## Package

The [`System.Net.Http.Json`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http.Json) package provides extension methods for <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpContent?displayProperty=fullName> that perform automatic serialization and deserialization using [`System.Text.Json`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json).

The [`System.Net.Http.Json`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http.Json) package is provided by the .NET shared framework and doesn't require adding a package reference to the app.

## Add the `HttpClient` service

This section covers implementation of the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> service to make web API calls.

The configuration examples in this section are only useful when a single web API is called for a single <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instance in the app. When the app must call multiple web APIs, each with its own base address and configuration, you can adopt the following approaches, which are covered later in this article:

* [Named `HttpClient` with `IHttpClientFactory`](#named-httpclient-with-ihttpclientfactory): Each web API is provided a unique name. When app code or a Razor component calls a web API, it uses a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instance to make the call.
* [Typed `HttpClient`](#typed-httpclient): Each web API is typed. When app code or a Razor component calls a web API, it uses a typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instance to make the call.

In the `Program` file, add an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> service if it isn't already present from a Blazor project template used to create the app:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => 
    new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress)
    });
```

The preceding example sets the base address with `builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress` (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>), which gets the base address for the app and is typically derived from the `<base>` tag's `href` value in the host page.

The most common use cases for using the client's own base address are:

* The client project (`.Client`) of a Blazor Web App (.NET 8 or later) makes web API calls from WebAssembly components or code that runs on the client in WebAssembly to APIs in the server app.
* The client project (**:::no-loc text="Client":::**) of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app makes web API calls to the server project (**:::no-loc text="Server":::**). Note that the hosted Blazor WebAssembly project template is no longer available in .NET 8 or later. However, hosted Blazor WebAssembly apps remain supported for .NET 8.

If you're calling an external web API (not in the same URL space as the client app), set the URI to the web API's base address. The following example sets the base address of the web API to `https://localhost:5001`, where a separate web API app is running and ready to respond to requests from the client app:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => 
    new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:5001")
    });
```

In most production apps, web API base addresses are managed via app settings, as the following examples demonstrate.

For local development, a separate web API app is running at a `localhost` address. The base address of the web API is assigned to a configuration key in the `Development` environment app settings file. The following examples use a key name of "`ApiServer`".

`wwwroot/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "ApiServer": "https://localhost:5001",
}
```

If a staging server is used, the staging web API base address is set in `wwwroot/appsettings.Staging.json`. The following example includes a version segment, which is a typical approach used to version web APIs:

```json
{
  "ApiServer": "https://staging-api.contoso.com/v1.0",
}
```

The production URI is set in the `Production` environment app settings file, `wwwroot/appsettings.Production.json`:

```json
{
  "ApiServer": "https://api.contoso.com/v1.0",
}
```

In the service registration, the appropriate app setting is read based on the app's environment:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => 
    new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.Configuration["ApiServer"] ?? "http://0.0.0.0")
    });
```

Nested configuration settings are also commonly used in production apps because web API configuration usually requires additional configuration settings, such as configuring scopes for requests.

`wwwroot/appsettings.Production.json`:

```json
"ApiServer": {
  "BaseUri": "https://api.contoso.com/v1.0",
  "Scopes": [
    "user.read"
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration and web API calls described in this article only apply to public web APIs. For guidance on using <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> to make authorized web API requests in clients that authenticate users, see <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios> after you've read this article. For a working example based on calling Microsoft Graph with a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>, see <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/graph-api?pivots=named-client-graph-api>.

In the service registration:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => 
    new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(
            builder.Configuration.GetSection("ApiServer")["BaseUri"] ?? 
                "http://0.0.0.0")
    });
```

## Client-side services for `HttpClient` fail during prerendering

*This section only applies to WebAssembly components in Blazor Web Apps.*

Blazor Web Apps normally prerender client-side WebAssembly components. <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> services aren't registered by default in a Blazor Web App's main project. If the app is run with only the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> services registered in the `.Client` project, as described in the [Add the `HttpClient` service](#add-the-httpclient-service) section, executing the app results in a runtime error:

> :::no-loc text="InvalidOperationException: Cannot provide a value for property 'Http' on type '{ASSEMBLY}.Client.Pages.{COMPONENT}'. There is no registered service of type 'System.Net.Http.HttpClient'.":::

Use ***either*** of the following approaches to resolve this problem:

* Add the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> services to the main project to make them available during component prerendering. Use the following service registration in the main project's `Program` file:

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
  ```

  No explicit package reference is required for the main project because <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> services are provided by the shared framework.

* If prerendering isn't required for the component, disable prerendering by following the guidance in <xref:blazor/components/render-modes#prerendering>. If you adopt this approach, you don't need to add <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> services to the main project of the Blazor Web App.

For more information, see [Client-side services fail to resolve during prerendering](xref:blazor/components/render-modes#client-side-services-fail-to-resolve-during-prerendering).

## `HttpClient` and JSON helpers

<xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> is available as a preconfigured service for making requests back to the origin server.

<xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> and JSON helpers (<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions?displayProperty=nameWithType>) are also used to call third-party web API endpoints. <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> is implemented using the browser's [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and is subject to its limitations, including enforcement of the same-origin policy, which is discussed later in this article in the *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)* section.

The client's base address is set to the originating server's address. Inject an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instance into a component using the [`@inject`](xref:mvc/views/razor#inject) directive:

```razor
@using System.Net.Http
@inject HttpClient Http
```

Use the <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName> namespace for access to <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions>, including <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync%2A>, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PutAsJsonAsync%2A>, and <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PostAsJsonAsync%2A>:

```razor
@using System.Net.Http.Json
```

### GET from JSON (`GetFromJsonAsync`)

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync%2A> sends an HTTP GET request and parses the JSON response body to create an object.

In the following component code, the `todoItems` are displayed by the component. <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync%2A> is called when the component is finished initializing ([`OnInitializedAsync`](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#component-initialization-oninitializedasync)).

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

```razor
@inject HttpClient Http

@if (todoItems == null)
{
    <p>No Todo Items found.</p>
}
else
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var item in todoItems)
        {
            <li>@item.Name</li>
        }
    </ul>
}

@code {
    private TodoItem[]? todoItems;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() => 
        todoItems = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<TodoItem[]>("api/TodoItems");
}
```

### POST as JSON (`PostAsJsonAsync`)

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PostAsJsonAsync%2A> sends a POST request to the specified URI containing the value serialized as JSON in the request body.

In the following component code, `newItemName` is provided by a bound element of the component. The `AddItem` method is triggered by selecting a `<button>` element.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

```razor
@inject HttpClient Http

<input @bind="newItemName" placeholder="New Todo Item" />
<button @onclick="AddItem">Add</button>

@code {
    private string? newItemName;

    private async Task AddItem()
    {
        var addItem = new TodoItem { Name = newItemName, IsComplete = false };
        await Http.PostAsJsonAsync("api/TodoItems", addItem);
    }
}
```

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PostAsJsonAsync%2A> returns an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage>. To deserialize the JSON content from the response message, use the <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpContentJsonExtensions.ReadFromJsonAsync%2A> extension method. The following example reads JSON weather data as an array:

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

```csharp
var content = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>() ??
    Array.Empty<WeatherForecast>();
```

In the preceding example, an empty array is created if no weather data is returned by the method, so `content` isn't null after the statement executes.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-6.0"

```csharp
var content = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>();
```

:::moniker-end

### PUT as JSON (`PutAsJsonAsync`)

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PutAsJsonAsync%2A> sends an HTTP PUT request with JSON-encoded content.

In the following component code, `editItem` values for `Name` and `IsCompleted` are provided by bound elements of the component. The item's `Id` is set when the item is selected in another part of the UI (not shown) and `EditItem` is called. The `SaveItem` method is triggered by selecting the `<button>` element. The following example doesn't show loading `todoItems` for brevity. See the [GET from JSON (`GetFromJsonAsync`)](#get-from-json-getfromjsonasync) section for an example of loading items.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

```razor
@inject HttpClient Http

<input type="checkbox" @bind="editItem.IsComplete" />
<input @bind="editItem.Name" />
<button @onclick="SaveItem">Save</button>

@code {
    private string? id;
    private TodoItem editItem = new TodoItem();

    private void EditItem(long id)
    {
        editItem = todoItems.Single(i => i.Id == id);
    }

    private async Task SaveItem() =>
        await Http.PutAsJsonAsync($"api/TodoItems/{editItem.Id}", editItem);
}
```

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PutAsJsonAsync%2A> returns an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage>. To deserialize the JSON content from the response message, use the <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpContentJsonExtensions.ReadFromJsonAsync%2A> extension method. The following example reads JSON weather data as an array:

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

```csharp
var content = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>() ??
    Array.Empty<WeatherForecast>();
```

In the preceding example, an empty array is created if no weather data is returned by the method, so `content` isn't null after the statement executes.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-6.0"

```csharp
var content = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>();
```

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-7.0"

### PATCH as JSON (`PatchAsJsonAsync`)

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PatchAsJsonAsync%2A> sends an HTTP PATCH request with JSON-encoded content.

In the following component code:

* `incompleteTodoItems` is an array of incomplete `TodoItem`. The following example doesn't show loading `incompleteTodoItems` for brevity. See the [GET from JSON (`GetFromJsonAsync`)](#get-from-json-getfromjsonasync) section for an example of loading items.
* The `UpdateItem` method is triggered by selecting the `<button>` element.
* The PATCH document is provided as a plain text string. The web API described in the <xref:tutorials/first-web-api> article doesn't handle PATCH requests by default. To make the PATCH example in this section work with the tutorial's web API, implement a PATCH controller action in the web API following the guidance in <xref:web-api/jsonpatch>. Later, this section demonstrates an example controller action and shows how to compose PATCH documents for ASP.NET Core web API apps that use .NET JSON PATCH support.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

```razor
@using System.Text.Json
@using System.Text.Json.Serialization
@inject HttpClient Http

<ul>
    @foreach (var item in incompleteTodoItems)
    {
        <li>
            @item.Name 
            <button @onclick="_ => UpdateItem(item.Id)">
                Mark 'Complete'
            </button>
        </li>
    }
</ul>

@code {
    private async Task UpdateItem(long id) =>
        await Http.PatchAsJsonAsync(
            $"api/TodoItems/{id}", 
            "[{\"operationType\":2,\"path\":\"/IsComplete\",\"op\":\"replace\",\"value\":true}]");
}
```

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PatchAsJsonAsync%2A> returns an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage>. To deserialize the JSON content from the response message, use the <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpContentJsonExtensions.ReadFromJsonAsync%2A> extension method. The following example reads JSON weather data as an array. An empty array is created if no weather data is returned by the method, so `content` isn't null after the statement executes:

```csharp
var content = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>() ??
    Array.Empty<WeatherForecast>();
```

<xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PatchAsJsonAsync%2A> receives a JSON PATCH document for the PATCH request. The preceding `UpdateItem` method called <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PatchAsJsonAsync%2A> with a PATCH document as a string with escaped quotes. Laid out with indentation, spacing, and non-escaped quotes, the unencoded PATCH document appears as the following JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "operationType": 2,
    "path": "/IsComplete",
    "op": "replace",
    "value": true
  }
]
```

To simplify the creation of PATCH documents in the app issuing PATCH requests, an app can use .NET JSON PATCH support, as the following guidance demonstrates.

Install the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch) NuGet package and use the API features of the package to compose a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch.JsonPatchDocument> for a PATCH request.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/package-reference.md)]

Add an `@using` directive for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch?displayProperty=fullName> namespace to the top of the Razor component:

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch
```

Compose the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch.JsonPatchDocument> for a `TodoItem` with `IsComplete` set to `true` using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch.JsonPatchDocument.Replace%2A> method:

```csharp
var patchDocument = new JsonPatchDocument<TodoItem>()
    .Replace(p => p.IsComplete, true);
```

Pass the document's operations (`patchDocument.Operations`) to the <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.PatchAsJsonAsync%2A> call. The following example shows how to make the call:

```csharp
private async Task UpdateItem(long id)
{
    await Http.PatchAsJsonAsync(
        $"api/TodoItems/{id}", 
        patchDocument.Operations, 
        new JsonSerializerOptions()
        {
            DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingDefault,
            WriteIndented = true
        });
}
```

<xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.DefaultIgnoreCondition?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingDefault?displayProperty=nameWithType> to ignore a property only if it equals the default value for its type.

<xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.WriteIndented?displayProperty=nameWithType> is used merely to present the JSON payload in a pleasant format for this article. Writing indented JSON has no bearing on processing PATCH requests and isn't typically performed in production apps for web API requests.

Next, follow the guidance in the <xref:web-api/jsonpatch> article to add a PATCH controller action to the web API.

Add a package reference for the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson) NuGet package to the web API app.

> [!NOTE]
> There's no need to add a package reference for the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch) package to the app because the reference to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson` package automatically transitively adds a package reference for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch`.

Add a custom JSON PATCH input formatter to the web API app.

`JSONPatchInputFormatter.cs`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;

public static class JSONPatchInputFormatter
{
    public static NewtonsoftJsonPatchInputFormatter Get()
    {
        var builder = new ServiceCollection()
            .AddLogging()
            .AddMvc()
            .AddNewtonsoftJson()
            .Services.BuildServiceProvider();

        return builder
            .GetRequiredService<IOptions<MvcOptions>>()
            .Value
            .InputFormatters
            .OfType<NewtonsoftJsonPatchInputFormatter>()
            .First();
    }
}
```

Configure the web API's controllers to use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson` package and process PATCH requests with the JSON PATCH input formatter. Insert the `JSONPatchInputFormatter` in the first position of MVC's input formatter collection so that it processes requests prior to any other input formatter.

In the `Program` file modify the call to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.AddControllers%2A>:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddControllers(options =>
{
    options.InputFormatters.Insert(0, JSONPatchInputFormatter.Get());
}).AddNewtonsoftJson();
```

In `Controllers/TodoItemsController.cs`, add a `using` statement for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch?displayProperty=fullName> namespace:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch;
```

In `Controllers/TodoItemsController.cs`, add the following `PatchTodoItem` action method:

```csharp
[HttpPatch("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> PatchTodoItem(long id, 
    JsonPatchDocument<TodoItem> patchDoc)
{
    if (patchDoc == null)
    {
        return BadRequest();
    }
    
    var todoItem = await _context.TodoItems.FindAsync(id);

    if (todoItem == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    patchDoc.ApplyTo(todoItem);

    _context.Entry(todoItem).State = EntityState.Modified;

    try
    {
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
    catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException) when (!TodoItemExists(id))
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    return NoContent();
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> As with the other examples in the <xref:web-api/jsonpatch> article, the preceding PATCH controller action doesn't protect the web API from over-posting attacks. For more information, see <xref:tutorials/first-web-api#prevent-over-posting>.

:::moniker-end

### Additional extension methods

<xref:System.Net.Http> includes additional extension methods for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses. <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient.DeleteAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is used to send an HTTP DELETE request to a web API.

In the following component code, the `<button>` element calls the `DeleteItem` method. The bound `<input>` element supplies the `id` of the item to delete.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

```razor
@inject HttpClient Http

<input @bind="id" />
<button @onclick="DeleteItem">Delete</button>

@code {
    private long id;

    private async Task DeleteItem() =>
        await Http.DeleteAsync($"api/TodoItems/{id}");
}
```

## Named `HttpClient` with `IHttpClientFactory`

<xref:System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory> services and the configuration of a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> are supported.

> [!NOTE]
> An alternative to using a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> from an <xref:System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory> is to use a typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>. For more information, see the [Typed `HttpClient`](#typed-httpclient) section.

Add the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Http`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Http) NuGet package to the app.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/package-reference.md)]

In the `Program` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("WebAPI", client => 
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress));
```

The preceding example sets the base address with `builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress` (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>), which gets the base address for the app and is typically derived from the `<base>` tag's `href` value in the host page.

The most common use cases for using the client's own base address are:

* The client project (`.Client`) of a Blazor Web App (.NET 8 or later) makes web API calls from WebAssembly components or code that runs on the client in WebAssembly to APIs in the server app.
* The client project (**:::no-loc text="Client":::**) of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app makes web API calls to the server project (**:::no-loc text="Server":::**).

If you're calling an external web API (not in the same URL space as the client app), set the URI to the web API's base address. The following example sets the base address of the web API to `https://localhost:5001`, where a separate web API app is running and ready to respond to requests from the client app:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("WebAPI", client => 
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(https://localhost:5001));
```

In the following component code:

* An instance of <xref:System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory> creates a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>.
* The named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> is used to issue a GET request for JSON weather forecast data from the web API.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

`FetchDataViaFactory.razor`:

```razor
@page "/fetch-data-via-factory"
@using {PROJECT NAME}.Shared
@inject IHttpClientFactory ClientFactory

<h1>Fetch data via <code>IHttpClientFactory</code></h1>

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <h2>Temperatures by Date</h2>

    <ul>
        @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
        {
            <li>
                @forecast.Date.ToShortDateString():
                @forecast.TemperatureC &#8451;
                @forecast.TemperatureF &#8457;
            </li>
        }
    </ul>
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[]? forecasts;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var client = ClientFactory.CreateClient("WebAPI");

        forecasts = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>(
            "WeatherForecast");
    }
}
```

For an additional example based on calling Microsoft Graph with a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>, see <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/graph-api?pivots=named-client-graph-api>.

## Typed `HttpClient`

Typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> uses one or more of the app's <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instances, default or named, to return data from one or more web API endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> An alternative to using a typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> is to use a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> from an <xref:System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory>. For more information, see the [Named `HttpClient` with `IHttpClientFactory`](#named-httpclient-with-ihttpclientfactory) section.

Add the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Http`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Http) NuGet package to the app.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/package-reference.md)]

`WeatherForecastHttpClient.cs`:

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

```csharp
using System.Net.Http.Json;

namespace BlazorSample.Client;

public class WeatherForecastHttpClient(HttpClient http)
{
    private readonly HttpClient http = http;
    private WeatherForecast[]? forecasts;

    public async Task<WeatherForecast[]> GetForecastAsync()
    {
        forecasts = await http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>(
            "WeatherForecast");

        return forecasts ?? [];
    }
}
```

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-8.0"

```csharp
using System.Net.Http.Json;

public class WeatherForecastHttpClient
{
    private readonly HttpClient http;
    private WeatherForecast[]? forecasts;

    public WeatherForecastHttpClient(HttpClient http)
    {
        this.http = http;
    }

    public async Task<WeatherForecast[]> GetForecastAsync()
    {
        forecasts = await http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>(
            "WeatherForecast");

        return forecasts ?? Array.Empty<WeatherForecast>();
    }
}
```

:::moniker-end

In the `Program` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<WeatherForecastHttpClient>(client => 
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress));
```

The preceding example sets the base address with `builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress` (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>), which gets the base address for the app and is typically derived from the `<base>` tag's `href` value in the host page.

The most common use cases for using the client's own base address are:

* The client project (`.Client`) of a Blazor Web App (.NET 8 or later) makes web API calls from WebAssembly components or code that runs on the client in WebAssembly to APIs in the server app.
* The client project (**:::no-loc text="Client":::**) of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app makes web API calls to the server project (**:::no-loc text="Server":::**).

If you're calling an external web API (not in the same URL space as the client app), set the URI to the web API's base address. The following example sets the base address of the web API to `https://localhost:5001`, where a separate web API app is running and ready to respond to requests from the client app:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<WeatherForecastHttpClient>(client => 
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(https://localhost:5001));
```

Components inject the typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> to call the web API.

In the following component code:

* An instance of the preceding `WeatherForecastHttpClient` is injected, which creates a typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>.
* The typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> is used to issue a GET request for JSON weather forecast data from the web API.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add an `@using` directive to the following component for <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

`FetchDataViaTypedHttpClient.razor`:

```razor
@page "/fetch-data-via-typed-httpclient"
@using {PROJECT NAME}.Shared
@inject WeatherForecastHttpClient Http

<h1>Fetch data via typed <code>HttpClient</code></h1>

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <h2>Temperatures by Date</h2>

    <ul>
        @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
        {
            <li>
                @forecast.Date.ToShortDateString():
                @forecast.TemperatureC &#8451;
                @forecast.TemperatureF &#8457;
            </li>
        }
    </ul>
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[]? forecasts;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        forecasts = await Http.GetForecastAsync();
    }
}
```

## `HttpClient` and `HttpRequestMessage` with Fetch API request options

[`HttpClient`](xref:fundamentals/http-requests) ([API documentation](xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient)) and <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage> can be used to customize requests. For example, you can specify the HTTP method and request headers. The following component makes a `POST` request to a web API endpoint and shows the response body.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName>.

`TodoRequest.razor`:

```razor
@page "/todo-request"
@using System.Net.Http.Headers
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication
@inject HttpClient Http
@inject IAccessTokenProvider TokenProvider

<h1>ToDo Request</h1>

<h1>ToDo Request Example</h1>

<button @onclick="PostRequest">Submit POST request</button>

<p>Response body returned by the server:</p>

<p>@responseBody</p>

@code {
    private string? responseBody;

    private async Task PostRequest()
    {
        var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage()
        {
            Method = new HttpMethod("POST"),
            RequestUri = new Uri("https://localhost:10000/api/TodoItems"),
            Content =
                JsonContent.Create(new TodoItem
                {
                    Name = "My New Todo Item",
                    IsComplete = false
                })
        };

        var tokenResult = await TokenProvider.RequestAccessToken();

        if (tokenResult.TryGetToken(out var token))
        {
            requestMessage.Headers.Authorization =
                new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token.Value);

            requestMessage.Content.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(
                "x-custom-header", "value");

            var response = await Http.SendAsync(requestMessage);
            var responseStatusCode = response.StatusCode;

            responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        }
    }

    public class TodoItem
    {
        public long Id { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public bool IsComplete { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Blazor's client-side implementation of <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> uses [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/fetch). Fetch API allows the configuration of several [request-specific options](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/fetch#Parameters). Options can be configured with <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage> extension methods shown in the following table.

| Extension method | Fetch API request property |
| --- | --- |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserRequestCache%2A> | [`cache`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request/cache) |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserRequestCredentials%2A> | [`credentials`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials) |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserRequestIntegrity%2A> | [`integrity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request/integrity) |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserRequestMode%2A> | [`mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request/mode) |

Set additional options using the generic <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserRequestOption%2A> extension method.

The HTTP response is typically buffered to enable support for synchronous reads on the response content. To enable support for response streaming, use the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserResponseStreamingEnabled%2A> extension method on the request.

To include credentials in a cross-origin request, use the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserRequestCredentials%2A> extension method:

```csharp
requestMessage.SetBrowserRequestCredentials(BrowserRequestCredentials.Include);
```

For more information on Fetch API options, see [MDN web docs: WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.fetch(): Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/fetch#Parameters).

## Call web API example

The following example calls a web API. The example requires a running web API based on the sample app described by the <xref:tutorials/first-web-api> article. This example makes requests to the web API at `https://localhost:10000/api/TodoItems`. If a different web API address is used, update the `ServiceEndpoint` constant value in the component's `@code` block.

The following example makes a [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](xref:security/cors) request from `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001` to the web API. Add the following CORS Middleware configuration to the web API's service's `Program` file:

```csharp
app.UseCors(policy => 
    policy.WithOrigins("http://localhost:5000", "https://localhost:5001")
    .AllowAnyMethod()
    .WithHeaders(HeaderNames.ContentType));
```

Adjust the domains and ports of `WithOrigins` as needed for the Blazor app. For more information, see <xref:security/cors>.

By default, ASP.NET Core apps use ports 5000 (HTTP) and 5001 (HTTPS). To run both apps on the same machine at the same time for testing, use a different port for the web API app (for example, port 10000). For more information on setting the port, see <xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints>.

## Handle errors

Handle web API response errors in developer code when they occur. For example, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync%2A> expects a JSON response from the web API with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`. If the response isn't in JSON format, content validation throws a <xref:System.NotSupportedException>.

In the following example, the URI endpoint for the weather forecast data request is misspelled. The URI should be to `WeatherForecast` but appears in the call as `WeatherForcast`, which is missing the letter `e` in `Forecast`.

The <xref:System.Net.Http.Json.HttpClientJsonExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync%2A> call expects JSON to be returned, but the web API returns HTML for an unhandled exception with a `Content-Type` of `text/html`. The unhandled exception occurs because the path to `/WeatherForcast` isn't found and middleware can't serve a page or view for the request.

In <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase.OnInitializedAsync%2A> on the client, <xref:System.NotSupportedException> is thrown when the response content is validated as non-JSON. The exception is caught in the `catch` block, where custom logic could log the error or present a friendly error message to the user.

> [!NOTE]
> When targeting ASP.NET Core 5.0 or earlier, add `@using` directives to the following component for <xref:System.Net.Http?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Net.Http.Json?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>.

`ReturnHTMLOnException.razor`:

```razor
@page "/return-html-on-exception"
@using {PROJECT NAME}.Shared
@inject HttpClient Http

<h1>Fetch data but receive HTML on unhandled exception</h1>

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <h2>Temperatures by Date</h2>

    <ul>
        @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
        {
            <li>
                @forecast.Date.ToShortDateString():
                @forecast.TemperatureC &#8451;
                @forecast.TemperatureF &#8457;
            </li>
        }
    </ul>
}

<p>
    @exceptionMessage
</p>

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[]? forecasts;
    private string? exceptionMessage;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        try
        {
            // The URI endpoint "WeatherForecast" is misspelled on purpose on the 
            // next line. See the preceding text for more information.
            forecasts = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>("WeatherForcast");
        }
        catch (NotSupportedException exception)
        {
            exceptionMessage = exception.Message;
        }
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding example is for demonstration purposes. A web API can be configured to return JSON even when an endpoint doesn't exist or an unhandled exception occurs on the server.

Server-based components call web APIs using <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instances, typically created using <xref:System.Net.Http.IHttpClientFactory>. For guidance that applies to server-side apps, see <xref:fundamentals/http-requests>.

A server-side app doesn't include an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> service by default. Provide an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> to the app using the [`HttpClient` factory infrastructure](xref:fundamentals/http-requests).

In the `Program` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
```

The following Razor component makes a request to a web API for GitHub branches similar to the *Basic Usage* example in the <xref:fundamentals/http-requests> article.

`CallWebAPI.razor`:

```razor
@page "/call-web-api"
@using System.Text.Json
@using System.Text.Json.Serialization
@inject IHttpClientFactory ClientFactory

<h1>Call web API from a Blazor Server Razor component</h1>

@if (getBranchesError || branches is null)
{
    <p>Unable to get branches from GitHub. Please try again later.</p>
}
else
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var branch in branches)
        {
            <li>@branch.Name</li>
        }
    </ul>
}

@code {
    private IEnumerable<GitHubBranch>? branches = Array.Empty<GitHubBranch>();
    private bool getBranchesError;
    private bool shouldRender;

    protected override bool ShouldRender() => shouldRender;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get,
            "https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/branches");
        request.Headers.Add("Accept", "application/vnd.github.v3+json");
        request.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "HttpClientFactory-Sample");

        var client = ClientFactory.CreateClient();

        var response = await client.SendAsync(request);

        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            using var responseStream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
            branches = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync
                <IEnumerable<GitHubBranch>>(responseStream);
        }
        else
        {
            getBranchesError = true;
        }

        shouldRender = true;
    }

    public class GitHubBranch
    {
        [JsonPropertyName("name")]
        public string? Name { get; set; }
    }
}
```

For an additional working example, see the server-side file upload example that uploads files to a web API controller in the <xref:blazor/file-uploads#upload-files-to-a-server-with-server-side-rendering> article.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Browser security restricts a webpage from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the webpage. This restriction is called the *same-origin policy*. The same-origin policy restricts (but doesn't prevent) a malicious site from reading sensitive data from another site. To make requests from the browser to an endpoint with a different origin, the *endpoint* must enable [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

:::zone pivot="webassembly"

For information on client-side CORS requests, see <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios#cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors>.

For information on CORS, see <xref:security/cors>. The article's examples don't pertain directly to Razor component scenarios, but the article is useful for learning general CORS concepts.

## Antiforgery support

To add antiforgery support to an HTTP request, inject the `AntiforgeryStateProvider` and add a `RequestToken` to the headers collection as a `RequestVerificationToken`:

```razor
@inject AntiforgeryStateProvider Antiforgery
```

```csharp
private async Task OnSubmit()
{
    var antiforgery = Antiforgery.GetAntiforgeryToken();
    var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, "action");
    request.Headers.Add("RequestVerificationToken", antiforgery.RequestToken);
    var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    ...
}
```

For more information, see <xref:blazor/security/index#antiforgery-support>.

## Blazor framework component examples for testing web API access

Various network tools are publicly available for testing web API backend apps directly, such as [Firefox Browser Developer](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com). Blazor framework's reference source includes <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> test assets that are useful for testing:

[`HttpClientTest` assets in the `dotnet/aspnetcore` GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Components/test/testassets/BasicTestApp/HttpClientTest)
