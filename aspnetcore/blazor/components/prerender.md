This article explains Razor component prerendering scenarios for server-rendered components in Blazor Web Apps and Blazor Server apps.

*Prerendering* is the process of statically rendering page content from the server to deliver HTML to the browser as quickly as possible. After the prerendered content is quickly displayed to the user, interactive content with active event handlers are rendered, replacing any content that was rendered previously. Prerendering can also improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines use to calculate page rank.

Prerendering is enabled by default for interactive components.

Internal navigation with interactive routing doesn't use prerendering because the page is already interactive. For more information, see [Static versus interactive routing](xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing#static-versus-interactive-routing) and [Interactive routing and prerendering](xref:blazor/state-management/prerendered-state-persistence#interactive-routing-and-prerendering).

[`OnAfterRender{Async}` component lifecycle events](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#after-component-render-onafterrenderasync) aren't called when prerendering, only after the component renders interactively.

## Disable prerendering

<!-- UPDATE 11.0 Tracking ...

                 ... for .NET 11 work in the following area. -->

Prerendering can complicate an app because the app's Razor components must render twice: once for prerendering and once for setting up interactivity. If the components are set up to run on WebAssembly, then you also must design your components so that they can run from both the server and the client.

To disable prerendering for a *component instance*, pass the `prerender` flag with a value of `false` to the render mode:

* `<... @rendermode="new InteractiveServerRenderMode(prerender: false)" />`
* `<... @rendermode="new InteractiveWebAssemblyRenderMode(prerender: false)" />`
* `<... @rendermode="new InteractiveAutoRenderMode(prerender: false)" />`

To disable prerendering in a *component definition*:

* `@rendermode @(new InteractiveServerRenderMode(prerender: false))`
* `@rendermode @(new InteractiveWebAssemblyRenderMode(prerender: false))`
* `@rendermode @(new InteractiveAutoRenderMode(prerender: false))`

To disable prerendering for the entire app, indicate the render mode at the highest-level interactive component in the app's component hierarchy that isn't a root component.

For apps based on the Blazor Web App project template, a render mode assigned to the entire app is specified where the `Routes` component is used in the `App` component (`Components/App.razor`). The following example sets the app's render mode to Interactive Server with prerendering disabled:

```razor
<Routes @rendermode="new InteractiveServerRenderMode(prerender: false)" />
```

Also, disable prerendering for the [`HeadOutlet` component](xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#headoutlet-component) in the `App` component:

```razor
<HeadOutlet @rendermode="new InteractiveServerRenderMode(prerender: false)" />
```

Making a root component, such as the `App` component, interactive with the `@rendermode` directive at the top of the root component's definition file (`.razor`) isn't supported. Therefore, prerendering can't be disabled directly by the `App` component.

Disabling prerendering using the preceding techniques only takes effect for top-level render modes. If a parent component specifies a render mode, the prerendering settings of its children are ignored.

## Persist prerendered state

Without persisting prerendered state, state used during prerendering is lost and must be recreated when the app is fully loaded. If any state is created asynchronously, the UI may flicker as the prerendered UI is replaced when the component is rerendered. For guidance on how to persist state during prerendering, see <xref:blazor/state-management/prerendered-state-persistence>.

## Client-side services fail to resolve during prerendering

Assuming that prerendering isn't disabled for a component or for the app, a component in the `.Client` project is prerendered on the server. Because the server doesn't have access to registered client-side Blazor services, it isn't possible to inject these services into a component without receiving an error that the service can't be found during prerendering.

For example, consider the following `Home` component in the `.Client` project in a Blazor Web App with [global Interactive WebAssembly or Interactive Auto rendering](xref:blazor/components/render-modes#apply-a-render-mode-to-the-entire-app). The component attempts to inject <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment> to obtain the environment's name.

```razor
@page "/"
@inject IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment Environment

<PageTitle>Home</PageTitle>

<h1>Home</h1>

<p>
    Environment: @Environment.Environment
</p>
```

No compile time error occurs, but a runtime error occurs during prerendering:

> :::no-loc text="Cannot provide a value for property 'Environment' on type 'BlazorSample.Client.Pages.Home'. There is no registered service of type 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment'.":::

This error occurs because the component must compile and execute on the server during prerendering, but <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment> isn't a registered service on the server.

Consider any of the following approaches to address this scenario:

* [Register the service on the server in addition to the client](#register-the-service-on-the-server-in-addition-to-the-client)
* [Inject a service that the app can use during prerendering](#inject-a-service-that-the-app-can-use-during-prerendering)
* [Make the service optional](#make-the-service-optional)
* [Create a service abstraction](#create-a-service-abstraction)
* [Disable prerendering for the component](#disable-prerendering-for-the-component)

### Register the service on the server in addition to the client

If the service supports server execution, register the service on the server in addition to the client so that it's available during prerendering. For an example of this scenario, see the guidance for <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> services in the [Blazor Web App external web APIs](xref:blazor/call-web-api#blazor-web-app-external-web-apis) section of the *Call web API* article.

### Inject a service that the app can use during prerendering

In some cases, the app can use a service on the server during prerendering and a different service on the client.

For example, the following code obtains the app's environment whether the code is running on the server or on the client by injecting <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostEnvironment> from the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions):

```csharp
private string? environmentName;

public Home(IHostEnvironment? serverEnvironment = null, 
    IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment? wasmEnvironment = null)
{
    environmentName = serverEnvironment?.EnvironmentName;
    environmentName ??= wasmEnvironment?.Environment;
}
```

However, this approach adds an additional dependency to the client project that isn't needed.

### Make the service optional

Make the service optional if it isn't required during prerendering using either of the following approaches.

The following example uses constructor injection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment>:

```csharp
private string? environmentName;

public Home(IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment? env = null)
{
    environmentName = env?.Environment;
}
```

Alternatively, inject <xref:System.IServiceProvider> to optionally obtain the service if it's available:

```razor
@page "/"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting
@inject IServiceProvider Services

<PageTitle>Home</PageTitle>

<h1>Home</h1>

<p>
    <b>Environment:</b> @environmentName
</p>

@code {
    private string? environmentName;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        if (Services.GetService<IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment>() is { } env)
        {
            environmentName = env.Environment;
        }
    }
}
```

### Create a service abstraction

If a different service implementation is needed on the server, create a service abstraction and create implementations for the service in the server and client projects. Register the services in each project. Inject the custom service abstraction into components where needed. The component then depends solely on the custom service abstraction.

In the case of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment>, we can reuse the existing interface instead of creating a new one:

`ServerHostEnvironment.cs`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;

public class ServerHostEnvironment(IWebHostEnvironment env, NavigationManager nav) : 
    IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment
{
    public string Environment => env.EnvironmentName;
    public string BaseAddress => nav.BaseUri;
}
```

In the server project's `Program` file, register the service:

```csharp
builder.Services.TryAddScoped<IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment, ServerHostEnvironment>();
```

At this point, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment> service can be [injected into an interactive WebAssembly or Auto component that is also prerendered from the server](xref:blazor/fundamentals/environments#read-the-environment-in-a-blazor-webassembly-app).

### Disable prerendering for the component

Disable prerendering for the component or for the entire app. For more information, see the [Disable prerendering](#disable-prerendering) section.
