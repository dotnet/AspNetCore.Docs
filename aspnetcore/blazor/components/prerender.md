This article explains Razor component prerendering scenarios for server-rendered components in Blazor Web Apps.

*Prerendering* is the process of initially rendering page content on the server without enabling event handlers for rendered controls. The server outputs the HTML UI of the page as soon as possible in response to the initial request, which makes the app feel more responsive to users. Prerendering can also improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines use to calculate page rank.

## Persist prerendered state

Without persisting prerendered state, state used during prerendering is lost and must be recreated when the app is fully loaded. If any state is created asynchronously, the UI may flicker as the prerendered UI is replaced when the component is rerendered.

Consider the following `PrerenderedCounter1` counter component. The component sets an initial random counter value during prerendering in [`OnInitialized` lifecycle method](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#component-initialization-oninitializedasync). After the SignalR connection to the client is established, the component rerenders, and the initial count value is replaced when `OnInitialized` executes a second time.

`PrerenderedCounter1.razor`:

:::code language="razor" source="~/../blazor-samples/8.0/BlazorSample_BlazorWebApp/Components/Pages/PrerenderedCounter1.razor":::

Run the app and inspect logging from the component. The following is example output.

> [!NOTE]
> If the app adopts interactive (enhanced) routing and the page is reached via an internal navigation, prerendering doesn't occur. Therefore, you must perform a full page reload for the `PrerenderedCounter1` component to see the following output.

> :::no-loc text="info: BlazorSample.Components.Pages.PrerenderedCounter1[0]":::  
> :::no-loc text="      currentCount set to 41":::  
> :::no-loc text="info: BlazorSample.Components.Pages.PrerenderedCounter1[0]":::  
> :::no-loc text="      currentCount set to 92":::

The first logged count occurs during prerendering. The count is set again after prerendering when the component is rerendered. There's also a flicker in the UI when the count updates from 41 to 92.

To retain the initial value of the counter during prerendering, Blazor supports persisting state in a prerendered page using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState> service (and for components embedded into pages or views of Razor Pages or MVC apps, the [Persist Component State Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/persist-component-state-tag-helper)).

To preserve prerendered state, decide what state to persist using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState> service. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState.RegisterOnPersisting%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> registers a callback to persist the component state before the app is paused. The state is retrieved when the app resumes.

The following example demonstrates the general pattern:

* The `{TYPE}` placeholder represents the type of data to persist.
* The `{TOKEN}` placeholder is a state identifier string.

```razor
@implements IDisposable
@inject PersistentComponentState ApplicationState

...

@code {
    private {TYPE} data;
    private PersistingComponentStateSubscription persistingSubscription;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        persistingSubscription = 
            ApplicationState.RegisterOnPersisting(PersistData);

        if (!ApplicationState.TryTakeFromJson<{TYPE}>(
            "{TOKEN}", out var restored))
        {
            data = await ...;
        }
        else
        {
            data = restored!;
        }
    }

    private Task PersistData()
    {
        ApplicationState.PersistAsJson("{TOKEN}", data);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    void IDisposable.Dispose()
    {
        persistingSubscription.Dispose();
    }
}
```

The following counter component example persists counter state during prerendering and retrieves the state to initialize the component.

`PrerenderedCounter2.razor`:

:::code language="razor" source="~/../blazor-samples/8.0/BlazorSample_BlazorWebApp/Components/Pages/PrerenderedCounter2.razor":::

When the component executes, `currentCount` is only set once during prerendering. The value is restored when the component is rerendered. The following is example output.

> [!NOTE]
> If the app adopts interactive routing and the page is reached via an internal navigation, prerendering doesn't occur. Therefore, you must perform a full page reload for the `PrerenderedCounter2` component to see the following output.

> :::no-loc text="info: BlazorSample.Components.Pages.PrerenderedCounter2[0]":::  
> :::no-loc text="      currentCount set to 96":::  
> :::no-loc text="info: BlazorSample.Components.Pages.PrerenderedCounter2[0]":::  
> :::no-loc text="      currentCount restored to 96":::

By initializing components with the same state used during prerendering, any expensive initialization steps are only executed once. The rendered UI also matches the prerendered UI, so no flicker occurs in the browser.

## Components embedded into pages and views (Razor Pages/MVC)

For components embedded into a page or view of a Razor Pages or MVC app, you must add the [Persist Component State Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/persist-component-state-tag-helper) with the `<persist-component-state />` HTML tag inside the closing `</body>` tag of the app's layout. **This is only required for Razor Pages and MVC apps.** For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/persist-component-state-tag-helper>.

`Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`:

```cshtml
<body>
    ...

    <persist-component-state />
</body>
```

## Interactive routing and prerendering

Internal navigation for interactive routing doesn't involve requesting new page content from the server. Therefore, prerendering doesn't occur for internal page requests.

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState> service only works on the initial page load and not across [enhanced page navigation events](xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing#enhanced-navigation-and-form-handling). If the app performs a full (non-enhanced) navigation to a page utilizing persistent component state, the persisted state is made available for the app to use when it becomes interactive. But if an interactive circuit has already been established and an enhanced navigation is performed to a page that renders persisted component state, that state isn't made available in the existing circuit. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState> service isn't aware of enhanced navigation, and there's no mechanism to deliver state updates to components that are already running.

## Prerendering guidance

Prerendering guidance is organized in the Blazor documentation by subject matter. The following links cover all of the prerendering guidance throughout the documentation set by subject:

  * <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.Router.OnNavigateAsync> is executed *twice* when prerendering: [Handle asynchronous navigation events with `OnNavigateAsync`](xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing#handle-asynchronous-navigation-events-with-onnavigateasync)
