# Prerender and integrate ASP.NET Core Razor components

This article explains Razor component integration scenarios for Blazor apps, including prerendering of Razor components on the server.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0 < aspnetcore-7.0"

:::zone pivot="webassembly"

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly [solution](xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln). When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.

Prerendering can improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines can use to calculate page rank.

## Solution configuration

### Prerendering configuration

To set up prerendering for a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app:

1. Host the Blazor WebAssembly app in an ASP.NET Core app. A standalone Blazor WebAssembly app can be added to an ASP.NET Core solution, or you can use a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app created from the [Blazor WebAssembly project template](xref:blazor/tooling) with the hosted option:

   * Visual Studio: In the **Additional information** dialog, select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox when creating the Blazor WebAssembly app. In this article's examples, the solution is named `BlazorHosted`.
   * Visual Studio Code/.NET CLI command shell: `dotnet new blazorwasm -ho` (use the `-ho|--hosted` option). Use the `-o|--output {LOCATION}` option to create a folder for the solution and set the solution's project namespaces. In this article's examples, the solution is named `BlazorHosted` (`dotnet new blazorwasm -ho -o BlazorHosted`).

   For the examples in this article, the client project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`, and the server project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Server`.

1. **Delete** the `wwwroot/index.html` file from the Blazor WebAssembly **`Client`** project.

1. In the **`Client`** project, **delete** the following lines in `Program.cs`:

   ```diff
   - builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
   - builder.RootComponents.Add<HeadOutlet>("head::after");
   ```

1. Add `_Host.cshtml` and `_Layout.cshtml` files to the **`Server`** project's `Pages` folder. You can obtain the files from a project created from the Blazor Server template using Visual Studio or using the .NET CLI with the `dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorServer` command in a command shell (the `-o BlazorServer` option creates a folder for the project). After placing the files into the **`Server`** project's `Pages` folder, make the following changes to the files.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The use of a layout page (`_Layout.cshtml`) with a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) for a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is required to control `<head>` content, such as the page's title (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component). For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#control-head-content-during-prerendering>.

   Make the following changes to the `_Layout.cshtml` file:

   * Update the `Pages` namespace at the top of the file to match the namespace of the **`Server`** app's pages. The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder in the following example represents the namespace of the donor app's pages that provided the `_Layout.cshtml` file:

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - @namespace {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages
     ```

     Add:

     ```razor
     @namespace BlazorHosted.Server.Pages
     ```

   * Add an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the **`Client`** project at the top of the file:

     ```razor
     @using BlazorHosted.Client
     ```

   * Update the stylesheet links to point to the WebAssembly project's stylesheets. In the following example, the client project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`. The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder represents the namespace of the donor app that provided the `_Layout.cshtml` file. Update the Component Tag Helper (`<component>` tag) for the `HeadOutlet` component to prerender the component.

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - <link href="css/site.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     - <link href="{APP NAMESPACE}.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     - <component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
     ```

     Add:

     ```razor
     <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     <link href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     <component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > Leave the `<link>` element that requests the Bootstrap stylesheet (`css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css`) in place.

   * Update the Blazor script source to use the client-side Blazor WebAssembly script:

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
     ```

     Add:

     ```html
     <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
     ```

   In the `_Host.cshtml` file:

   * Change the `Pages` namespace to that of the **`Client`** project. The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder represents the namespace of the donor app's pages that provided the `_Host.cshtml` file:

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - @namespace {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages
     ```

     Add:

     ```razor
     @namespace BlazorHosted.Client
     ```

   * Update the `render-mode` of the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) to prerender the root `App` component with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssemblyPrerendered>:

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
     ```

     Add:

     ```razor
     <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
     ```

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Prerendering isn't supported for authentication endpoints (`/authentication/` path segment). For more information, see <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios#support-prerendering-with-authentication>.

1. In endpoint mapping of the **`Server`** project in `Program.cs`, change the fallback from the `index.html` file to the `_Host.cshtml` page:

   Delete:

   ```diff
   - app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html");
   ```

   Add:

   ```csharp
   app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   ```

1. If the **`Client`** and **`Server`** projects use one or more common services during prerendering, factor the service registrations into a method that can be called from both projects. For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/dependency-injection#register-common-services-in-a-hosted-blazor-webassembly-solution>.

1. Run the **`Server`** project. The hosted Blazor WebAssembly app is prerendered by the **`Server`** project for clients.

### Configuration for embedding Razor components into pages and views

The following sections and examples for embedding Razor components from the **`Client`** Blazor WebAssembly app into pages and views of the server app require additional configuration.

The **`Server`** project must have the following files and folders.

Razor Pages:

* `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
* `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.css`
* `Pages/_ViewImports.cshtml`
* `Pages/_ViewStart.cshtml`

MVC:

* `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
* `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.css`
* `Views/_ViewImports.cshtml`
* `Views/_ViewStart.cshtml`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The use of a layout page (`_Layout.cshtml`) with a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) for a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is required to control `<head>` content, such as the page's title (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component). For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#control-head-content-during-prerendering>.

The preceding files can be obtained by generating an app from the ASP.NET Core project templates using:

* Visual Studio's new project creation tools.
* Opening a command shell and executing `dotnet new webapp -o {APP NAME}` (Razor Pages) or `dotnet new mvc -o {APP NAME}` (MVC). The option `-o|--output` with a value for the `{APP NAME}` placeholder provides a name for the app and creates a folder for the app.

Update the namespaces in the imported `_ViewImports.cshtml` file to match those in use by the **`Server`** project receiving the files.

`Pages/_ViewImports.cshtml` (Razor Pages):

```razor
@using BlazorHosted.Server
@namespace BlazorHosted.Server.Pages
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

`Views/_ViewImports.cshtml` (MVC):

```razor
@using BlazorHosted.Server
@using BlazorHosted.Server.Models
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

Update the imported layout file, which is `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` for Razor Pages or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` for MVC.

First, delete the title and the stylesheet from the donor project, which is `RPDonor.styles.css` in the following example. The `{APP NAME}` placeholder represents the donor project's app name.

```diff
- <title>@ViewData["Title"] - {APP NAME}</title>
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/RPDonor.styles.css" asp-append-version="true" />
```

Include the **`Client`** project's styles in the layout file. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`. The `<title>` element can be updated at the same time.

Place the following lines in the `<head>` content of the layout file:

```html
<title>@ViewData["Title"] - BlazorHosted</title>
<link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" asp-append-version="true" />
<component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
```

The imported layout contains two `Home` (`Index` page) and `Privacy` navigation links. To make the `Home` links point to the hosted Blazor WebAssembly app, change the hyperlinks:

```diff
- <a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index">{APP NAME}</a>
+ <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">BlazorHosted</a>
```

```diff
- <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index">Home</a>
+ <a class="nav-link text-dark" href="/">Home</a>
```

In an MVC layout file:

```diff
- <a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" 
-     asp-action="Index">{APP NAME}</a>
+ <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">BlazorHosted</a>
```

```diff
- <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" 
-     asp-action="Index">Home</a>
+ <a class="nav-link text-dark" href="/">Home</a>
```

Update the `<footer>` element's app name. The following example uses the app name `BlazorHosted`:

```diff
- &copy; {DATE} - {DONOR NAME} - <a asp-area="" asp-page="/Privacy">Privacy</a>
+ &copy; {DATE} - BlazorHosted - <a asp-area="" asp-page="/Privacy">Privacy</a>
```

In the preceding example, the `{DATE}` placeholder represents the copyright date in an app generated from the Razor Pages or MVC project template.

To make the `Privacy` link lead to a privacy page (Razor Pages), add a privacy page to the **`Server`** project.

`Pages/Privacy.cshtml` in the **`Server`** project:

```cshtml
@page
@model PrivacyModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Privacy Policy";
}
<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Use this page to detail your site's privacy policy.</p>
```

For an MVC-based privacy view, create a privacy view in the **`Server`** project.

`View/Home/Privacy.cshtml` in the **`Server`** project:

```cshtml
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Privacy Policy";
}
<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Use this page to detail your site's privacy policy.</p>
```

In the `Home` controller of the MVC app, return the view.

Add the following code to `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

```csharp
public IActionResult Privacy()
{
    return View();
}
```

If you import files from a donor app, be sure to update any namespaces in the files to match that of the **`Server`** project (for example, `BlazorHosted.Server`).

Import static assets to the **`Server`** project from the donor project's `wwwroot` folder:

* `wwwroot/css` folder and contents
* `wwwroot/js` folder and contents
* `wwwroot/lib` folder and contents

If the donor project is created from an ASP.NET Core project template and the files aren't modified, you can copy the entire `wwwroot` folder from the donor project into the **`Server`** project and remove the :::no-loc text="favicon"::: icon file.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid placing the static asset into both the **`Client`** and **`Server`** `wwwroot` folders. If the same file is present in both folders, an exception is thrown because the static asset in each folder shares the same web root path. Therefore, host a static asset in either `wwwroot` folder, not both.

After adopting the preceding configuration, embed Razor components into pages or views of the **`Server`** project. Use the guidance in the following sections of this article:

* *Render components in a page or view with the Component Tag Helper*
* *Render components in a page or view with a CSS selector*

## Render components in a page or view with the Component Tag Helper

After [configuring the solution](#solution-configuration), including the [additional configuration](#configuration-for-embedding-razor-components-into-pages-and-views), the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) supports two render modes for rendering a component from a Blazor WebAssembly app in a page or view:

* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssembly>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssemblyPrerendered>

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections). To avoid using the full namespace for the `Counter` component with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) (`{APP ASSEMBLY}.Pages.Counter`), add an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the client project's `Pages` namespace. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`.

In the **`Server`** project, `Pages/RazorPagesCounter1.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@page
@using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

Run the **`Server`** project. Navigate to the Razor page at `/razorpagescounter1`. The prerendered `Counter` component is embedded in the page.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the component:

* Is prerendered into the page.
* Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

Additional work might be required depending on the static resources that components use and how layout pages are organized in an app. Typically, scripts are added to a page or view's `Scripts` render section and stylesheets are added to the layout's `<head>` element content.

### Set child content through a render fragment

The [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) doesn't support receiving a [`RenderFragment` delegate for child content](xref:blazor/components/index#child-content-render-fragments) (for example, `param-ChildContent="..."`). We recommend creating a Razor component (`.razor`) that references the component you want to render with the child content you want to pass and then invoke the Razor component from the page or view.

### Ensure that top-level prerendered components aren't trimmed out on publish

If a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) directly references a component from a library that's subject to trimming on publish, the component might be trimmed out during publish because there are no references to it from client-side app code. As a result, the component isn't prerendered, leaving a blank spot in the output. If this occurs, instruct the trimmer to preserve the library component by adding a [`DynamicDependency` attribute](xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicDependencyAttribute) to any class in the client-side app. To preserve a component called `SomeLibraryComponentToBePreserved`, add the following to any component:

```razor
@using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis
@attribute [DynamicDependency(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.All, 
    typeof(SomeLibraryComponentToBePreserved))]
```

The preceding approach usually isn't required because in most cases the app prerenders its components (which are not trimmed), which in turn references components from libraries (causing them also not to be trimmed). Only use `DynamicDependency` explicitly for prerendering a library component directly when the library is subject to trimming.

## Render components in a page or view with a CSS selector

After [configuring the solution](#solution-configuration), including the [additional configuration](#configuration-for-embedding-razor-components-into-pages-and-views), add root components to the **`Client`** project of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution in the `Program.cs` file. In the following example, the `Counter` component is declared as a root component with a CSS selector that selects the element with the `id` that matches `counter-component`. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`.

In `Program.cs` file of the **`Client`** project, add the namespace for the project's Razor components to the top of the file:

```csharp
using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages;
```

After the `builder` is established in `Program.cs`, add the `Counter` component as a root component:

```csharp
builder.RootComponents.Add<Counter>("#counter-component");
```

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections).

In the **`Server`** project, `Pages/RazorPagesCounter2.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@page

<div id="counter-component">Loading...</div>

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

Run the **`Server`** project. Navigate to the Razor page at `/razorpagescounter2`. The prerendered `Counter` component is embedded in the page.

Additional work might be required depending on the static resources that components use and how layout pages are organized in an app. Typically, scripts are added to a page or view's `Scripts` render section and stylesheets are added to the layout's `<head>` element content.

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding example throws a <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException> if a Blazor WebAssembly app is prerendered and integrated into a Razor Pages or MVC app **simultaneously** with the use of a CSS selector. Navigating to one of the **`Client`** project's Razor components or navigating to a page or view of the **`Server`** with an embedded component throws one or more <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException>.
>
> This is normal behavior because prerendering and integrating a Blazor WebAssembly app with routable Razor components is incompatible with the use of CSS selectors.
>
> If you've been working with the examples in the preceding sections and just wish to see the CSS selector work in your sample app, comment out the specification of the `App` root component of the **`Client`** project's `Program.cs` file:
>
> ```diff
> - builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
> + //builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
> ```
>
> Navigate to the page or view with the embedded Razor component that uses a CSS selector (for example, `/razorpagescounter2` of the preceding example). The page or view loads with the embedded component, and the embedded component functions as expected.

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps. When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.
  
Prerendering can improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines can use to calculate page rank.

After [configuring the project](#configuration), use the guidance in the following sections depending on the project's requirements:

* Routable components: For components that are directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when visitors should be able to make an HTTP request in their browser for a component with an [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive.
  * [Use routable components in a Razor Pages app](#use-routable-components-in-a-razor-pages-app)
  * [Use routable components in an MVC app](#use-routable-components-in-an-mvc-app)
* [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view): For components that aren't directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when the app embeds components into existing pages and views with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

## Configuration

Use the following guidance to integrate Razor components into pages and views of an existing Razor Pages or MVC app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The use of a layout page (`_Layout.cshtml`) with a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) for a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is required to control `<head>` content, such as the page's title (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component). For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#control-head-content-during-prerendering>.

1. In the project's layout file:

   * Add the following `<base>` tag and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component Tag Helper to the `<head>` element in `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```html
     <base href="~/" />
     <component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
     ```

     The `href` value (the *app base path*) in the preceding example assumes that the app resides at the root URL path (`/`). If the app is a sub-application, follow the guidance in the *App base path* section of the <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/index#app-base-path> article.
  
     The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is used to render head (`<head>`) content for page titles (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component) set by Razor components. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content>.

   * Add a `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script immediately before the `Scripts` render section (`@await RenderSectionAsync(...)`) in the app's layout.

     `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```html
     <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
     ```

     The framework adds the `blazor.server.js` script to the app. There's no need to manually add a `blazor.server.js` script file to the app.

1. Add an imports file to the root folder of the project with the following content. Change the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder to the namespace of the project.

   `_Imports.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using System.Net.Http
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization
   @using Microsoft.JSInterop
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}
   ```

1. Register the Blazor Server services in `Program.cs` where services are registered:

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor();
   ```

1. Add the Blazor Hub endpoint to the endpoints of `Program.cs` where routes are mapped.

   Place the following line after the call to `MapRazorPages` (Razor Pages) or `MapControllerRoute` (MVC):

   ```csharp
   app.MapBlazorHub();
   ```

1. Integrate components into any page or view. For example, add a `Counter` component to the project's `Shared` folder.

   `Pages/Shared/Counter.razor` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/Counter.razor` (MVC):

   ```razor
   <h1>Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

   **Razor Pages**:

   In the project's `Index` page of a Razor Pages app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the page. When the `Index` page loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Pages/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages.Shared
   @model IndexModel
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
   }

   <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

   **MVC**:

   In the project's `Index` view of an MVC app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the view. When the `Index` view loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Views.Shared
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
   }

   <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

For more information, see the [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view) section.

## Use routable components in a Razor Pages app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in Razor Pages apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
           <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` page to the project with the following content.

   `Pages/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page "/blazor"
   @namespace {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages.Shared
   @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

   In this scenario, components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The use of a layout page (`_Layout.cshtml`) with a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) for a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is required to control `<head>` content, such as the page's title (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component). For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#control-head-content-during-prerendering>.
  
   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. In the `Program.cs` endpoints, add a low-priority route for the `_Host` page as the last endpoint:

   ```csharp
   app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project. The following example is a `RoutableCounter` component based on the `Counter` component in the Blazor project templates.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <PageTitle>Routable Counter</PageTitle>

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Use routable components in an MVC app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in MVC apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
           <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` view to the project with the following content.

   `Views/Home/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @namespace {APP NAMESPACE}.Views.Shared
   @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.
     
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The use of a layout page (`_Layout.cshtml`) with a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) for a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is required to control `<head>` content, such as the page's title (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component). For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#control-head-content-during-prerendering>.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. Add an action to the Home controller.

   `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

   ```csharp
   public IActionResult Blazor()
   {
      return View("_Host");
   }
   ```

1. In the `Program.cs` endpoints, add a low-priority route for the controller action that returns the `_Host` view:

   ```csharp
   app.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   ```

1. Create a `Pages` folder in the MVC app and add routable components. The following example is a `RoutableCounter` component based on the `Counter` component in the Blazor project templates.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <PageTitle>Routable Counter</PageTitle>

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Render components from a page or view

*This section pertains to adding components to pages or views, where the components aren't directly routable from user requests.*

To render a component from a page or view, use the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

### Render stateful interactive components

Stateful interactive components can be added to a Razor page or view.

When the page or view renders:

* The component is prerendered with the page or view.
* The initial component state used for prerendering is lost.
* New component state is created when the SignalR connection is established.

The following Razor page renders a `Counter` component:

```cshtml
<h1>Razor Page</h1>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.
     
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The use of a layout page (`_Layout.cshtml`) with a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) for a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is required to control `<head>` content, such as the page's title (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component). For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#control-head-content-during-prerendering>.

### Render noninteractive components

In the following Razor page, the `Counter` component is statically rendered with an initial value that's specified using a form. Since the component is statically rendered, the component isn't interactive:

```cshtml
<h1>Razor Page</h1>

<form>
    <input type="number" asp-for="InitialValue" />
    <button type="submit">Set initial value</button>
</form>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="Static" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.
     
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The use of a layout page (`_Layout.cshtml`) with a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) for a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is required to control `<head>` content, such as the page's title (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component). For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content#control-head-content-during-prerendering>.

## Component namespaces

When using a custom folder to hold the project's Razor components, add the namespace representing the folder to either the page/view or to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file. In the following example:

* Components are stored in the `Components` folder of the project.
* The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder is the project's namespace. `Components` represents the name of the folder.

```cshtml
@using {APP NAMESPACE}.Components
```

The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages` folder of a Razor Pages app or the `Views` folder of an MVC app.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index#namespaces>.

## Persist prerendered state

Without persisting prerendered state, state used during prerendering is lost and must be recreated when the app is fully loaded. If any state is setup asynchronously, the UI may flicker as the prerendered UI is replaced with temporary placeholders and then fully rendered again.

To solve these problems, Blazor supports persisting state in a prerendered page using the [Persist Component State Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/persist-component-state-tag-helper). Add the Tag Helper's tag, `<persist-component-state />`, inside the closing `</body>` tag.

`Pages/_Layout.cshtml`:

```cshtml
<body>
    ...

    <persist-component-state />
</body>
```

Decide what state to persist using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState> service. [`PersistentComponentState.RegisterOnPersisting`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState.RegisterOnPersisting%2A) registers a callback to persist the component state before the app is paused. The state is retrieved when the application resumes.

The following example is an updated version of the `FetchData` component in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app based on the Blazor project template. The `WeatherForecastPreserveState` component persists weather forecast state during prerendering and then retrieves the state to initialize the component. The [Persist Component State Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/persist-component-state-tag-helper) persists the component state after all component invocations.

`Pages/WeatherForecastPreserveState.razor`:

```razor
@page "/weather-forecast-preserve-state"
@implements IDisposable
@using BlazorSample.Shared
@inject IWeatherForecastService WeatherForecastService
@inject PersistentComponentState ApplicationState

<PageTitle>Weather Forecast</PageTitle>

<h1>Weather forecast</h1>

<p>This component demonstrates fetching data from the server.</p>

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Temp. (C)</th>
                <th>Temp. (F)</th>
                <th>Summary</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@forecast.Date.ToShortDateString()</td>
                    <td>@forecast.TemperatureC</td>
                    <td>@forecast.TemperatureF</td>
                    <td>@forecast.Summary</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[] forecasts = Array.Empty<WeatherForecast>();
    private PersistingComponentStateSubscription persistingSubscription;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        persistingSubscription = 
            ApplicationState.RegisterOnPersisting(PersistForecasts);

        if (!ApplicationState.TryTakeFromJson<WeatherForecast[]>(
            "fetchdata", out var restored))
        {
            forecasts = 
                await WeatherForecastService.GetForecastAsync(DateTime.Now);
        }
        else
        {
            forecasts = restored!;
        }
    }

    private Task PersistForecasts()
    {
        ApplicationState.PersistAsJson("fetchdata", forecasts);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    void IDisposable.Dispose()
    {
        persistingSubscription.Dispose();
    }
}
```

By initializing components with the same state used during prerendering, any expensive initialization steps are only executed once. The rendered UI also matches the prerendered UI, so no flicker occurs in the browser.

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly [solution](xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln). When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.
  
Prerendering can improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines can use to calculate page rank.

## Solution configuration

### Prerendering configuration

To set up prerendering for a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app:

1. Host the Blazor WebAssembly app in an ASP.NET Core app. A standalone Blazor WebAssembly app can be added to an ASP.NET Core solution, or you can use a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app created from the [Blazor WebAssembly project template](xref:blazor/tooling) with the hosted option:

   * Visual Studio: In the **Additional information** dialog, select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox when creating the Blazor WebAssembly app. In this article's examples, the solution is named `BlazorHosted`.
   * Visual Studio Code/.NET CLI command shell: `dotnet new blazorwasm -ho` (use the `-ho|--hosted` option). Use the `-o|--output {LOCATION}` option to create a folder for the solution and set the solution's project namespaces. In this article's examples, the solution is named `BlazorHosted` (`dotnet new blazorwasm -ho -o BlazorHosted`).

   For the examples in this article, the client project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`, and the server project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Server`.

1. **Delete** the `wwwroot/index.html` file from the Blazor WebAssembly **`Client`** project.

1. In the **`Client`** project, **delete** the following line in `Program.cs`:

   ```diff
   - builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
   ```

1. Add a `Pages/_Host.cshtml` file to the **`Server`** project's `Pages` folder. You can obtain a `_Host.cshtml` file from a project created from the Blazor Server template with the `dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorServer` command in a command shell (the `-o BlazorServer` option creates a folder for the project). After placing the `Pages/_Host.cshtml` file into the **`Server`** project of the hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution, make the following changes to the file:

   * Provide an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the **`Client`** project (for example, `@using BlazorHosted.Client`).
   * Update the stylesheet links to point to the WebAssembly project's stylesheets. In the following example, the client project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`:

     ```diff
     - <link href="css/site.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     - <link href="_content/BlazorServer/_framework/scoped.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     + <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     + <link href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > Leave the `<link>` element that requests the Bootstrap stylesheet (`css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css`) in place.

   * Update the `render-mode` of the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) to prerender the root `App` component with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssemblyPrerendered>:

     ```diff
     - <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
     + <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
     ```

   * Update the Blazor script source to use the client-side Blazor WebAssembly script:

     ```diff
     - <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
     + <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
     ```

1. In `Startup.Configure` of the **`Server`** project, change the fallback from the `index.html` file to the `_Host.cshtml` page.

   `Startup.cs`:

   ```diff
   - endpoints.MapFallbackToFile("index.html");
   + endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   ```

1. If the **`Client`** and **`Server`** projects use one or more common services during prerendering, factor the service registrations into a method that can be called from both projects. For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/dependency-injection#register-common-services-in-a-hosted-blazor-webassembly-solution>.

1. Run the **`Server`** project. The hosted Blazor WebAssembly app is prerendered by the **`Server`** project for clients.

### Configuration for embedding Razor components into pages and views

The following sections and examples in this article for embedding Razor components of the client Blazor WebAssembly app into pages and views of the server app require additional configuration.

Use a default Razor Pages or MVC layout file in the **`Server`** project. The **`Server`** project must have the following files and folders.

Razor Pages:

* `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
* `Pages/_ViewImports.cshtml`
* `Pages/_ViewStart.cshtml`

MVC:

* `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
* `Views/_ViewImports.cshtml`
* `Views/_ViewStart.cshtml`

Obtain the preceding files from an app created from the Razor Pages or MVC project template. For more information, see <xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start> or <xref:tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc>.

Update the namespaces in the imported `_ViewImports.cshtml` file to match those in use by the **`Server`** project receiving the files.

Update the imported layout file (`_Layout.cshtml`) to include the **`Client`** project's styles. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`. The `<title>` element can be updated at the same time.

`Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

```diff
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
-   <title>@ViewData["Title"] - DonorProject</title>
+   <title>@ViewData["Title"] - BlazorHosted</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
+   <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
+   <link href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

The imported layout contains `Home` and `Privacy` navigation links. To make the `Home` link point to the hosted Blazor WebAssembly app, change the hyperlink:

```diff
- <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index">Home</a>
+ <a class="nav-link text-dark" href="/">Home</a>
```

In an MVC layout file:

```diff
- <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" 
-     asp-action="Index">Home</a>
+ <a class="nav-link text-dark" href="/">Home</a>
```

To make the `Privacy` link lead to a privacy page, add a privacy page to the **`Server`** project.

`Pages/Privacy.cshtml` in the **`Server`** project:

```cshtml
@page
@model BlazorHosted.Server.Pages.PrivacyModel
@{
}

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
```

If an MVC-based privacy view is preferred, create a privacy view in the **`Server`** project.

`View/Home/Privacy.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Privacy Policy";
}

<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>
```

In the `Home` controller, return the view.

`Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

```csharp
public IActionResult Privacy()
{
    return View();
}
```

Import static assets to the **`Server`** project from the donor project's `wwwroot` folder:

* `wwwroot/css` folder and contents
* `wwwroot/js` folder and contents
* `wwwroot/lib` folder and contents

If the donor project is created from an ASP.NET Core project template and the files aren't modified, you can copy the entire `wwwroot` folder from the donor project into the **`Server`** project and remove the :::no-loc text="favicon"::: icon file.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid placing the static asset into both the **`Client`** and **`Server`** `wwwroot` folders. If the same file is present in both folders, an exception is thrown because the static asset in each folder shares the same web root path. Therefore, host a static asset in either `wwwroot` folder, not both.

## Render components in a page or view with the Component Tag Helper

After [configuring the solution](#solution-configuration), including the [additional configuration](#configuration-for-embedding-razor-components-into-pages-and-views), the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) supports two render modes for rendering a component from a Blazor WebAssembly app in a page or view:

* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssembly>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssemblyPrerendered>

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections). To avoid using the full namespace for the `Counter` component with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) (`{APP ASSEMBLY}.Pages.Counter`), add an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the client project's `Pages` namespace. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`.

In the **`Server`** project, `Pages/RazorPagesCounter1.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@page
@using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

Run the **`Server`** project. Navigate to the Razor page at `/razorpagescounter1`. The prerendered `Counter` component is embedded in the page.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the component:

* Is prerendered into the page.
* Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

Additional work might be required depending on the static resources that components use and how layout pages are organized in an app. Typically, scripts are added to a page or view's `Scripts` render section and stylesheets are added to the layout's `<head>` element content.

## Render components in a page or view with a CSS selector

After [configuring the solution](#solution-configuration), including the [additional configuration](#configuration-for-embedding-razor-components-into-pages-and-views), add root components to the **`Client`** project of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution in `Program.cs`. In the following example, the `Counter` component is declared as a root component with a CSS selector that selects the element with the `id` that matches `counter-component`. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`.

In `Program.cs` of the **`Client`** project, add the namespace for the project's Razor components to the top of the file:

```csharp
using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages;
```

After the `builder` is established in `Program.cs`, add the `Counter` component as a root component:

```csharp
builder.RootComponents.Add<Counter>("#counter-component");
```

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections).

In the **`Server`** project, `Pages/RazorPagesCounter2.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@page

<div id="counter-component">Loading...</div>

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

Run the **`Server`** project. Navigate to the Razor page at `/razorpagescounter2`. The prerendered `Counter` component is embedded in the page.

Additional work might be required depending on the static resources that components use and how layout pages are organized in an app. Typically, scripts are added to a page or view's `Scripts` render section and stylesheets are added to the layout's `<head>` element content.

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding example throws a <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException> if a Blazor WebAssembly app is prerendered and integrated into a Razor Pages or MVC app **simultaneously** with a CSS selector. Navigating to one of the **`Client`** project's Razor components throws the following exception:
>
> > Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException: Could not find any element matching selector '#counter-component'.
>
> This is normal behavior because prerendering and integrating a Blazor WebAssembly app with routable Razor components is incompatible with the use of CSS selectors.

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps. When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.

Prerendering can improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines can use to calculate page rank.

After [configuring the project](#configuration), use the guidance in the following sections depending on the project's requirements:

* Routable components: For components that are directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when visitors should be able to make an HTTP request in their browser for a component with an [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive.
  * [Use routable components in a Razor Pages app](#use-routable-components-in-a-razor-pages-app)
  * [Use routable components in an MVC app](#use-routable-components-in-an-mvc-app)
* [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view): For components that aren't directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when the app embeds components into existing pages and views with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

## Configuration

An existing Razor Pages or MVC app can integrate Razor components into pages and views:

1. In the project's layout file:

   * Add the following `<base>` tag to the `<head>` element in `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```html
     <base href="~/" />
     ```

     The `href` value (the *app base path*) in the preceding example assumes that the app resides at the root URL path (`/`). If the app is a sub-application, follow the guidance in the *App base path* section of the <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/index#app-base-path> article.

   * Add a `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script immediately before the `Scripts` render section.

     `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```cshtml
         ...
         <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>

         @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
     </body>
     ```

     The framework adds the `blazor.server.js` script to the app. There's no need to manually add a `blazor.server.js` script file to the app.

1. Add an imports file to the root folder of the project with the following content. Change the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder to the namespace of the project.

   `_Imports.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using System.Net.Http
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
   @using Microsoft.JSInterop
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}
   ```

1. Register the Blazor Server service in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.

   In `Startup.cs`:

   ```csharp
   services.AddServerSideBlazor();
   ```

1. Add the Blazor Hub endpoint to the endpoints (`app.UseEndpoints`) of `Startup.Configure`.

   `Startup.cs`:

   ```csharp
   endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
   ```

1. Integrate components into any page or view. For example, add a `Counter` component to the project's `Shared` folder.

   `Pages/Shared/Counter.razor` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/Counter.razor` (MVC):

   ```razor
   <h1>Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

   **Razor Pages**:

   In the project's `Index` page of a Razor Pages app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the page. When the `Index` page loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Pages/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages.Shared
   @model IndexModel
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
   }

   <div>
       <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </div>
   ```

   In the preceding example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the app's namespace.

   **MVC**:

   In the project's `Index` view of an MVC app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the view. When the `Index` view loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Views.Shared
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
   }

   <div>
       <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </div>
   ```

For more information, see the [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view) section.

## Use routable components in a Razor Pages app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in Razor Pages apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

   [!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/prefer-exact-matches.md)]

1. Add a `_Host` page to the project with the following content.

   `Pages/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page "/blazor"
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. In the `Startup.Configure` endpoints of `Startup.cs`, add a low-priority route for the `_Host` page as the last endpoint:

   ```csharp
   endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   ```

   The following example shows the added line in a typical app's endpoint configuration:

   ```csharp
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       endpoints.MapRazorPages();
       endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
       endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   });
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Use routable components in an MVC app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in MVC apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

   [!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/prefer-exact-matches.md)]

1. Add a `_Host` view to the project with the following content.

   `Views/Home/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. Add an action to the Home controller.

   `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

   ```csharp
   public IActionResult Blazor()
   {
      return View("_Host");
   }
   ```

1. In the `Startup.Configure` endpoints of `Startup.cs`, add a low-priority route for the controller action that returns the `_Host` view:

   ```csharp
   endpoints.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   ```
   
   The following example shows the added line in a typical app's endpoint configuration:

   ```csharp
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
           name: "default",
           pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
       endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
       endpoints.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   });
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Render components from a page or view

*This section pertains to adding components to pages or views, where the components aren't directly routable from user requests.*

To render a component from a page or view, use the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

### Render stateful interactive components

Stateful interactive components can be added to a Razor page or view.

When the page or view renders:

* The component is prerendered with the page or view.
* The initial component state used for prerendering is lost.
* New component state is created when the SignalR connection is established.

The following Razor page renders a `Counter` component:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

### Render noninteractive components

In the following Razor page, the `Counter` component is statically rendered with an initial value that's specified using a form. Since the component is statically rendered, the component isn't interactive:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<form>
    <input type="number" asp-for="InitialValue" />
    <button type="submit">Set initial value</button>
</form>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="Static" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

## Component namespaces

When using a custom folder to hold the project's Razor components, add the namespace representing the folder to either the page/view or to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file. In the following example:

* Components are stored in the `Components` folder of the project.
* The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder is the project's namespace. `Components` represents the name of the folder.

```cshtml
@using {APP NAMESPACE}.Components
```

The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages` folder of a Razor Pages app or the `Views` folder of an MVC app.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index#namespaces>.

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps. When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.

Prerendering can improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines can use to calculate page rank.

After [configuring the project](#configuration), use the guidance in the following sections depending on the project's requirements:

* Routable components: For components that are directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when visitors should be able to make an HTTP request in their browser for a component with an [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive.
  * [Use routable components in a Razor Pages app](#use-routable-components-in-a-razor-pages-app)
  * [Use routable components in an MVC app](#use-routable-components-in-an-mvc-app)
* [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view): For components that aren't directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when the app embeds components into existing pages and views with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

## Configuration

An existing Razor Pages or MVC app can integrate Razor components into pages and views:

1. In the project's layout file:

   * Add the following `<base>` tag to the `<head>` element in `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```diff
     + <base href="~/" />
     ```

     The `href` value (the *app base path*) in the preceding example assumes that the app resides at the root URL path (`/`). If the app is a sub-application, follow the guidance in the *App base path* section of the <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/index#app-base-path> article.

   * Add a `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script immediately before the `Scripts` render section.

     `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```cshtml
         ...
         <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>

         @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
     </body>
     ```

     The framework adds the `blazor.server.js` script to the app. There's no need to manually add a `blazor.server.js` script file to the app.

1. Add an imports file to the root folder of the project with the following content. Change the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder to the namespace of the project.

   `_Imports.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using System.Net.Http
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
   @using Microsoft.JSInterop
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}
   ```

1. Register the Blazor Server service in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.

   `Startup.cs`:

   ```csharp
   services.AddServerSideBlazor();
   ```

1. Add the Blazor Hub endpoint to the endpoints (`app.UseEndpoints`) of `Startup.Configure`.

   `Startup.cs`:

   ```csharp
   endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
   ```

1. Integrate components into any page or view. For example, add a `Counter` component to the project's `Shared` folder.

   `Pages/Shared/Counter.razor` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/Counter.razor` (MVC):

   ```razor
   <h1>Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

   **Razor Pages**:

   In the project's `Index` page of a Razor Pages app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the page. When the `Index` page loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Pages/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages.Shared
   @model IndexModel
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
   }

   <div>
       <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </div>
   ```

   In the preceding example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the app's namespace.

   **MVC**:

   In the project's `Index` view of an MVC app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the view. When the `Index` view loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Views.Shared
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
   }

   <div>
       <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </div>
   ```

For more information, see the [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view) section.

## Use routable components in a Razor Pages app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in Razor Pages apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` page to the project with the following content.

   `Pages/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page "/blazor"
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. In the `Startup.Configure` endpoints of `Startup.cs`, add a low-priority route for the `_Host` page as the last endpoint:

   ```csharp
   endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   ```

   The following example shows the added line in a typical app's endpoint configuration:

   ```csharp
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       endpoints.MapRazorPages();
       endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
       endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   });
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Use routable components in an MVC app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in MVC apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` view to the project with the following content.

   `Views/Home/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. Add an action to the Home controller.

   `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

   ```csharp
   public IActionResult Blazor()
   {
      return View("_Host");
   }
   ```

1. In the `Startup.Configure` endpoints of `Startup.cs`, add a low-priority route for the controller action that returns the `_Host` view:

   ```csharp
   endpoints.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   ```

   The following example shows the added line in a typical app's endpoint configuration:

   ```csharp
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
           name: "default",
           pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
       endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
       endpoints.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   });
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Render components from a page or view

*This section pertains to adding components to pages or views, where the components aren't directly routable from user requests.*

To render a component from a page or view, use the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

### Render stateful interactive components

Stateful interactive components can be added to a Razor page or view.

When the page or view renders:

* The component is prerendered with the page or view.
* The initial component state used for prerendering is lost.
* New component state is created when the SignalR connection is established.

The following Razor page renders a `Counter` component:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

### Render noninteractive components

In the following Razor page, the `Counter` component is statically rendered with an initial value that's specified using a form. Since the component is statically rendered, the component isn't interactive:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<form>
    <input type="number" asp-for="InitialValue" />
    <button type="submit">Set initial value</button>
</form>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="Static" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

## Component namespaces

When using a custom folder to hold the project's Razor components, add the namespace representing the folder to either the page/view or to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file. In the following example:

* Components are stored in the `Components` folder of the project.
* The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder is the project's namespace. `Components` represents the name of the folder.

```cshtml
@using {APP NAMESPACE}.Components
```

The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages` folder of a Razor Pages app or the `Views` folder of an MVC app.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index#namespaces>.

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly [solution](xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln). When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.

Prerendering can improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines can use to calculate page rank.

## Solution configuration

### Prerendering configuration

To set up prerendering for a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app:

1. Host the Blazor WebAssembly app in an ASP.NET Core app. A standalone Blazor WebAssembly app can be added to an ASP.NET Core solution, or you can use a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app created from the [Blazor WebAssembly project template](xref:blazor/tooling) with the hosted option:

   * Visual Studio: In the **Additional information** dialog, select the **ASP.NET Core Hosted** checkbox when creating the Blazor WebAssembly app. In this article's examples, the solution is named `BlazorHosted`.
   * Visual Studio Code/.NET CLI command shell: `dotnet new blazorwasm -ho` (use the `-ho|--hosted` option). Use the `-o|--output {LOCATION}` option to create a folder for the solution and set the solution's project namespaces. In this article's examples, the solution is named `BlazorHosted` (`dotnet new blazorwasm -ho -o BlazorHosted`).

   For the examples in this article, the hosted solution's name (assembly name) is `BlazorHosted`. The client project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`, and the server project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Server`.

1. **Delete** the `wwwroot/index.html` file from the Blazor WebAssembly **`Client`** project.

1. In the **`Client`** project, **delete** the following lines in `Program.cs`:

   ```diff
   - builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
   - builder.RootComponents.Add<HeadOutlet>("head::after");
   ```

1. Add `_Host.cshtml` file to the **`Server`** project's `Pages` folder. You can obtain the files from a project created from the Blazor Server template using Visual Studio or using the .NET CLI with the `dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorServer` command in a command shell (the `-o BlazorServer` option creates a folder for the project). After placing the files into the **`Server`** project's `Pages` folder, make the following changes to the files.

   Make the following changes to the `_Host.cshtml` file:

   * Update the `Pages` namespace at the top of the file to match the namespace of the **`Server`** app's pages. The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder in the following example represents the namespace of the donor app's pages that provided the `_Host.cshtml` file:

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - @namespace {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages
     ```

     Add:

     ```razor
     @namespace BlazorHosted.Server.Pages
     ```

   * Add an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the **`Client`** project at the top of the file:

     ```razor
     @using BlazorHosted.Client
     ```

   * Update the stylesheet links to point to the WebAssembly project's stylesheets. In the following example, the client project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`. The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder represents the namespace of the donor app that provided the `_Host.cshtml` file. Update the Component Tag Helper (`<component>` tag) for the `HeadOutlet` component to prerender the component.

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - <link href="css/site.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     - <link href="{APP NAMESPACE}.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     - <component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
     ```

     Add:

     ```razor
     <link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     <link href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
     <component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > Leave the `<link>` element that requests the Bootstrap stylesheet (`css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css`) in place.

   * Update the Blazor script source to use the client-side Blazor WebAssembly script:

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
     ```

     Add:

     ```html
     <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
     ```

   * Update the `render-mode` of the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) to prerender the root `App` component with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssemblyPrerendered>:

     Delete:

     ```diff
     - <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
     ```

     Add:

     ```razor
     <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
     ```

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Prerendering isn't supported for authentication endpoints (`/authentication/` path segment). For more information, see <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios#support-prerendering-with-authentication>.

1. In the `Program.cs` file of the **`Server`** project, change the fallback endpoint from the `index.html` file to the `_Host.cshtml` page:

   Delete:

   ```diff
   - app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html");
   ```

   Add:

   ```csharp
   app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   ```

1. If the **`Client`** and **`Server`** projects use one or more common services during prerendering, factor the service registrations into a method that can be called from both projects. For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/dependency-injection#register-common-services-in-a-hosted-blazor-webassembly-solution>.

1. Run the **`Server`** project. The hosted Blazor WebAssembly app is prerendered by the **`Server`** project for clients.

### Configuration for embedding Razor components into pages and views

The following sections and examples for embedding Razor components from the **`Client`** Blazor WebAssembly app into pages and views of the server app require additional configuration.

The **`Server`** project must have the following files and folders.

Razor Pages:

* `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
* `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.css`
* `Pages/_ViewImports.cshtml`
* `Pages/_ViewStart.cshtml`

MVC:

* `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
* `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.css`
* `Views/_ViewImports.cshtml`
* `Views/_ViewStart.cshtml`

The preceding files can be obtained by generating an app from the ASP.NET Core project templates using:

* Visual Studio's new project creation tools.
* Opening a command shell and executing `dotnet new webapp -o {APP NAME}` (Razor Pages) or `dotnet new mvc -o {APP NAME}` (MVC). The option `-o|--output` with a value for the `{APP NAME}` placeholder provides a name for the app and creates a folder for the app.

Update the namespaces in the imported `_ViewImports.cshtml` file to match those in use by the **`Server`** project receiving the files.

`Pages/_ViewImports.cshtml` (Razor Pages):

```razor
@using BlazorHosted.Server
@namespace BlazorHosted.Server.Pages
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

`Views/_ViewImports.cshtml` (MVC):

```razor
@using BlazorHosted.Server
@using BlazorHosted.Server.Models
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

Update the imported layout file, which is `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` for Razor Pages or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` for MVC.

First, delete the title and the stylesheet from the donor project, which is `RPDonor.styles.css` in the following example. The `{APP NAME}` placeholder represents the donor project's app name.

```diff
- <title>@ViewData["Title"] - {APP NAME}</title>
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/RPDonor.styles.css" asp-append-version="true" />
```

Include the **`Client`** project's styles in the layout file. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`. The `<title>` element can be updated at the same time.

Place the following lines in the `<head>` content of the layout file:

```html
<title>@ViewData["Title"] - BlazorHosted</title>
<link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="BlazorHosted.Client.styles.css" asp-append-version="true" />
<component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />
```

The imported layout contains two `Home` (`Index` page) and `Privacy` navigation links. To make the `Home` links point to the hosted Blazor WebAssembly app, change the hyperlinks:

```diff
- <a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index">{APP NAME}</a>
+ <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">BlazorHosted</a>
```

```diff
- <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index">Home</a>
+ <a class="nav-link text-dark" href="/">Home</a>
```

In an MVC layout file:

```diff
- <a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" 
-     asp-action="Index">{APP NAME}</a>
+ <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">BlazorHosted</a>
```

```diff
- <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" 
-     asp-action="Index">Home</a>
+ <a class="nav-link text-dark" href="/">Home</a>
```

Update the `<footer>` element's app name. The following example uses the app name `BlazorHosted`:

```diff
- &copy; {DATE} - {DONOR NAME} - <a asp-area="" asp-page="/Privacy">Privacy</a>
+ &copy; {DATE} - BlazorHosted - <a asp-area="" asp-page="/Privacy">Privacy</a>
```

In the preceding example, the `{DATE}` placeholder represents the copyright date in an app generated from the Razor Pages or MVC project template.

To make the `Privacy` link lead to a privacy page (Razor Pages), add a privacy page to the **`Server`** project.

`Pages/Privacy.cshtml` in the **`Server`** project:

```cshtml
@page
@model PrivacyModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Privacy Policy";
}
<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Use this page to detail your site's privacy policy.</p>
```

For an MVC-based privacy view, create a privacy view in the **`Server`** project.

`View/Home/Privacy.cshtml` in the **`Server`** project:

```cshtml
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Privacy Policy";
}
<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Use this page to detail your site's privacy policy.</p>
```

In the `Home` controller of the MVC app, return the view.

Add the following code to `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

```csharp
public IActionResult Privacy()
{
    return View();
}
```

If you import files from a donor app, be sure to update any namespaces in the files to match that of the **`Server`** project (for example, `BlazorHosted.Server`).

Import static assets to the **`Server`** project from the donor project's `wwwroot` folder:

* `wwwroot/css` folder and contents
* `wwwroot/js` folder and contents
* `wwwroot/lib` folder and contents

If the donor project is created from an ASP.NET Core project template and the files aren't modified, you can copy the entire `wwwroot` folder from the donor project into the **`Server`** project and remove the :::no-loc text="favicon"::: icon file.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid placing the static asset into both the **`Client`** and **`Server`** `wwwroot` folders. If the same file is present in both folders, an exception is thrown because the static assets share the same web root path. Therefore, host a static asset in either of the `wwwroot` folders, not both.

After adopting the preceding configuration, embed Razor components into pages or views of the **`Server`** project. Use the guidance in the following sections of this article:

* *Render components in a page or view with the Component Tag Helper*
* *Render components in a page or view with a CSS selector*

## Render components in a page or view with the Component Tag Helper

After [configuring the solution](#solution-configuration), including the [additional configuration](#configuration-for-embedding-razor-components-into-pages-and-views), the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) supports two render modes for rendering a component from a Blazor WebAssembly app in a page or view:

* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssembly>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.WebAssemblyPrerendered>

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections). To avoid using the full namespace for the `Counter` component with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) (`{APP ASSEMBLY}.Pages.Counter`), add an [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directive for the client project's `Pages` namespace. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`.

In the **`Server`** project, `Pages/RazorPagesCounter1.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@page
@using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="WebAssemblyPrerendered" />

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

Run the **`Server`** project. Navigate to the Razor page at `/razorpagescounter1`. The prerendered `Counter` component is embedded in the page.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the component:

* Is prerendered into the page.
* Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

Additional work might be required depending on the static resources that components use and how layout pages are organized in an app. Typically, scripts are added to a page or view's `Scripts` render section and stylesheets are added to the layout's `<head>` element content.

### Set child content through a render fragment

The [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) doesn't support receiving a [`RenderFragment` delegate for child content](xref:blazor/components/index#child-content-render-fragments) (for example, `param-ChildContent="..."`). We recommend creating a Razor component (`.razor`) that references the component you want to render with the child content you want to pass and then invoke the Razor component from the page or view.

### Ensure that top-level prerendered components aren't trimmed out on publish

If a [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper) directly references a component from a library that's subject to trimming on publish, the component might be trimmed out during publish because there are no references to it from client-side app code. As a result, the component isn't prerendered, leaving a blank spot in the output. If this occurs, instruct the trimmer to preserve the library component by adding a [`DynamicDependency` attribute](xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicDependencyAttribute) to any class in the client-side app. To preserve a component called `SomeLibraryComponentToBePreserved`, add the following to any component:

```razor
@using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis
@attribute [DynamicDependency(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.All, 
    typeof(SomeLibraryComponentToBePreserved))]
```

The preceding approach usually isn't required because in most cases the app prerenders its components (which are not trimmed), which in turn references components from libraries (causing them also not to be trimmed). Only use `DynamicDependency` explicitly for prerendering a library component directly when the library is subject to trimming.

## Render components in a page or view with a CSS selector

After [configuring the solution](#solution-configuration), including the [additional configuration](#configuration-for-embedding-razor-components-into-pages-and-views), add root components to the **`Client`** project of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution in the `Program.cs` file. In the following example, the `Counter` component is declared as a root component with a CSS selector that selects the element with the `id` that matches `counter-component`. In the following example, the **`Client`** project's namespace is `BlazorHosted.Client`.

In `Program.cs` file of the **`Client`** project, add the namespace for the project's Razor components to the top of the file:

```csharp
using BlazorHosted.Client.Pages;
```

After the `builder` is established in `Program.cs`, add the `Counter` component as a root component:

```csharp
builder.RootComponents.Add<Counter>("#counter-component");
```

In the following Razor Pages example, the `Counter` component is rendered in a page. To make the component interactive, the Blazor WebAssembly script is included in the page's [render section](xref:mvc/views/layout#sections).

In the **`Server`** project, `Pages/RazorPagesCounter2.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@page

<div id="counter-component">Loading...</div>

@section Scripts {
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
}
```

Run the **`Server`** project. Navigate to the Razor page at `/razorpagescounter2`. The prerendered `Counter` component is embedded in the page.

Additional work might be required depending on the static resources that components use and how layout pages are organized in an app. Typically, scripts are added to a page or view's `Scripts` render section and stylesheets are added to the layout's `<head>` element content.

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding example throws a <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException> if a Blazor WebAssembly app is prerendered and integrated into a Razor Pages or MVC app **simultaneously** with the use of a CSS selector. Navigating to one of the **`Client`** project's Razor components or navigating to a page or view of the **`Server`** with an embedded component throws one or more <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException>.
>
> This is normal behavior because prerendering and integrating a Blazor WebAssembly app with routable Razor components is incompatible with the use of CSS selectors.
>
> If you've been working with the examples in the preceding sections and just wish to see the CSS selector work in your sample app, comment out the specification of the `App` root component of the **`Client`** project's `Program.cs` file:
>
> ```diff
> - builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
> + //builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
> ```
>
> Navigate to the page or view with the embedded Razor component that uses a CSS selector (for example, `/razorpagescounter2` of the preceding example). The page or view loads with the embedded component, and the embedded component functions as expected.

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps. When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.
  
Prerendering can improve [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) by rendering content for the initial HTTP response that search engines can use to calculate page rank.

After [configuring the project](#configuration), use the guidance in the following sections depending on the project's requirements:

* For components that are directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when visitors should be able to make an HTTP request in their browser for a component with an [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive.
  * [Use routable components in a Razor Pages app](#use-routable-components-in-a-razor-pages-app)
  * [Use routable components in an MVC app](#use-routable-components-in-an-mvc-app)
* For components that aren't directly routable from user requests, see the [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view) section. Follow this guidance when the app embeds components into existing pages and views with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

## Configuration

Use the following guidance to integrate Razor components into pages and views of an existing Razor Pages or MVC app.

1. Add an imports file to the root folder of the project with the following content. Change the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder to the namespace of the project.

   `_Imports.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using System.Net.Http
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization
   @using Microsoft.JSInterop
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}
   ```

1. In the project's layout file (`Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` in Razor Pages apps or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` in MVC apps):

   * Add the following `<base>` tag and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component Tag Helper to the `<head>` element:

     ```cshtml
     <base href="~/" />
     <component type="typeof(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet)" 
         render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
     ```

     The `href` value (the *app base path*) in the preceding example assumes that the app resides at the root URL path (`/`). If the app is a sub-application, follow the guidance in the *App base path* section of the <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/index#app-base-path> article.

     The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component is used to render head (`<head>`) content for page titles (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.PageTitle> component) and other head elements (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadContent> component) set by Razor components. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content>.

   * Add a `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script immediately before the `Scripts` render section (`@await RenderSectionAsync(...)`):

     ```html
     <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
     ```

     The framework adds the `blazor.server.js` script to the app. There's no need to manually add a `blazor.server.js` script file to the app.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Typically, the layout loads via a `_ViewStart.cshtml` file.

1. Register the Blazor Server services in `Program.cs` where services are registered:

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor();
   ```

1. Add the Blazor Hub endpoint to the endpoints of `Program.cs` where routes are mapped. Place the following line after the call to `MapRazorPages` (Razor Pages) or `MapControllerRoute` (MVC):

   ```csharp
   app.MapBlazorHub();
   ```

1. Integrate components into any page or view. For example, add a `Counter` component to the project's `Shared` folder.

   `Pages/Shared/Counter.razor` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/Counter.razor` (MVC):

   ```razor
   <h1>Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

   **Razor Pages**:

   In the project's `Index` page of a Razor Pages app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the page. When the `Index` page loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Pages/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages.Shared
   @model IndexModel
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
   }

   <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

   **MVC**:

   In the project's `Index` view of an MVC app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the view. When the `Index` view loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Views.Shared
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
   }

   <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

## Use routable components in a Razor Pages app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in Razor Pages apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
           <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` page to the project with the following content. Replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the app's namespace.

   `Pages/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page
   @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

   <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The preceding example assumes that the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component and Blazor script (`_framework/blazor.server.js`) are rendered by the app's layout. For more information, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
  
   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. In the `Program.cs` endpoints, add a low-priority route for the `_Host` page as the last endpoint:

   ```csharp
   app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project. The following example is a `RoutableCounter` component based on the `Counter` component in the Blazor project templates.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <PageTitle>Routable Counter</PageTitle>

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Use routable components in an MVC app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in MVC apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
           <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` view to the project with the following content. Replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the app's namespace.

   `Views/Home/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

   <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The preceding example assumes that the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HeadOutlet> component and Blazor script (`_framework/blazor.server.js`) are rendered by the app's layout. For more information, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. Add an action to the Home controller.

   `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

   ```csharp
   public IActionResult Blazor()
   {
      return View("_Host");
   }
   ```

1. In the `Program.cs` endpoints, add a low-priority route for the controller action that returns the `_Host` view:

   ```csharp
   app.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   ```

1. Create a `Pages` folder in the MVC app and add routable components. The following example is a `RoutableCounter` component based on the `Counter` component in the Blazor project templates.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <PageTitle>Routable Counter</PageTitle>

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Render components from a page or view

*This section pertains to adding components to pages or views, where the components aren't directly routable from user requests.*

To render a component from a page or view, use the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

### Render stateful interactive components

Stateful interactive components can be added to a Razor page or view.

When the page or view renders:

* The component is prerendered with the page or view.
* The initial component state used for prerendering is lost.
* New component state is created when the SignalR connection is established.

The following Razor page renders a `Counter` component:

```cshtml
<h1>Razor Page</h1>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

### Render noninteractive components

In the following Razor page, the `Counter` component is statically rendered with an initial value that's specified using a form. Since the component is statically rendered, the component isn't interactive:

```cshtml
<h1>Razor Page</h1>

<form>
    <input type="number" asp-for="InitialValue" />
    <button type="submit">Set initial value</button>
</form>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="Static" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

## Component namespaces

When using a custom folder to hold the project's Razor components, add the namespace representing the folder to either the page/view or to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file. In the following example:

* Components are stored in the `Components` folder of the project.
* The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder is the project's namespace. `Components` represents the name of the folder.

```cshtml
@using {APP NAMESPACE}.Components
```

The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages` folder of a Razor Pages app or the `Views` folder of an MVC app.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index#namespaces>.

## Persist prerendered state

Without persisting prerendered state, state used during prerendering is lost and must be recreated when the app is fully loaded. If any state is setup asynchronously, the UI may flicker as the prerendered UI is replaced with temporary placeholders and then fully rendered again.

To solve these problems, Blazor supports persisting state in a prerendered page using the [Persist Component State Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/persist-component-state-tag-helper). Add the Tag Helper's tag, `<persist-component-state />`, inside the closing `</body>` tag.

`Pages/_Host.cshtml`:

```cshtml
<body>
    ...

    <persist-component-state />
</body>
```

Decide what state to persist using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState> service. [`PersistentComponentState.RegisterOnPersisting`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.PersistentComponentState.RegisterOnPersisting%2A) registers a callback to persist the component state before the app is paused. The state is retrieved when the application resumes.

The following example is an updated version of the `FetchData` component in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app based on the Blazor project template. The `WeatherForecastPreserveState` component persists weather forecast state during prerendering and then retrieves the state to initialize the component. The [Persist Component State Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/persist-component-state-tag-helper) persists the component state after all component invocations.

`Pages/WeatherForecastPreserveState.razor`:

```razor
@page "/weather-forecast-preserve-state"
@implements IDisposable
@using BlazorSample.Shared
@inject IWeatherForecastService WeatherForecastService
@inject PersistentComponentState ApplicationState

<PageTitle>Weather Forecast</PageTitle>

<h1>Weather forecast</h1>

<p>This component demonstrates fetching data from the server.</p>

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Temp. (C)</th>
                <th>Temp. (F)</th>
                <th>Summary</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@forecast.Date.ToShortDateString()</td>
                    <td>@forecast.TemperatureC</td>
                    <td>@forecast.TemperatureF</td>
                    <td>@forecast.Summary</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[] forecasts = Array.Empty<WeatherForecast>();
    private PersistingComponentStateSubscription persistingSubscription;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        persistingSubscription = 
            ApplicationState.RegisterOnPersisting(PersistForecasts);

        if (!ApplicationState.TryTakeFromJson<WeatherForecast[]>(
            "fetchdata", out var restored))
        {
            forecasts = 
                await WeatherForecastService.GetForecastAsync(DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now));
        }
        else
        {
            forecasts = restored!;
        }
    }

    private Task PersistForecasts()
    {
        ApplicationState.PersistAsJson("fetchdata", forecasts);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    void IDisposable.Dispose()
    {
        persistingSubscription.Dispose();
    }
}
```

By initializing components with the same state used during prerendering, any expensive initialization steps are only executed once. The rendered UI also matches the prerendered UI, so no flicker occurs in the browser.
