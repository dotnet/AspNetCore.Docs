# ASP.NET Core Blazor project structure

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This article describes the files and folders that make up a Blazor app generated from a Blazor project template.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

## Blazor Web App

Blazor Web App project template: `blazor`

The Blazor Web App project template provides a single starting point for using Razor components to build any style of web UI, both server-side rendered and client-side rendered. It combines the strengths of the existing Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly hosting models with server-side rendering, streaming rendering, enhanced navigation and form handling, and the ability to add interactivity using either Blazor Server or Blazor WebAssembly on a per-component basis.

If both client-side rendering (CSR) and interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR) are selected on app creation, the project template uses the Interactive Auto render mode. The automatic rendering mode initially uses interactive SSR while the .NET app bundle and runtime are downloaded to the browser. After the .NET WebAssembly runtime is activated, rendering switches to CSR.

By default, the Blazor Web App template enables both static and interactive server-side rendering using a single project. If you also enable Interactive WebAssembly rendering, the project includes an additional client project (`.Client`) for your WebAssembly-based components. The built output from the client project is downloaded to the browser and executed on the client. Components using the Interactive WebAssembly or Interactive Auto render modes must be located in the `.Client` project.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/render-modes>.

* Server project:

  * `Components` folder: 

    * `Layout` folder: Contains the following layout components and stylesheets:
      * `MainLayout` component (`MainLayout.razor`): The app's [layout component](xref:blazor/components/layouts).
      * `MainLayout.razor.css`: Stylesheet for the app's main layout.
      * `NavMenu` component (`NavMenu.razor`): Implements sidebar navigation. Includes the [`NavLink` component](xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing#navlink-component) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.NavLink>), which renders navigation links to other Razor components. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.NavLink> component indicates to the user which component is currently displayed.
      * `NavMenu.razor.css`: Stylesheet for the app's navigation menu.

    * `Pages` folder: Contains the app's routable server-side Razor components (`.razor`). The route for each page is specified using the [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive. The template includes the following:
      * `Counter` component (`Counter.razor`): Implements the *Counter* page.
      * `Error` component (`Error.razor`): Implements the *Error* page.
      * `Home` component (`Home.razor`): Implements the *Home* page.
      * `Weather` component (`Weather.razor`): Implements the *Weather forecast* page.

    * `App` component (`App.razor`): The root component of the app with HTML `<head>` markup, the `Routes` component, and the Blazor `<script>` tag. The root component is the first component that the app loads.

    * `Routes` component (`Routes.razor`): Sets up routing using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.Router> component. For client-side interactive components, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.Router> component intercepts browser navigation and renders the page that matches the requested address.

    * `_Imports.razor`: Includes common Razor directives to include in the server-rendered app components (`.razor`), such as [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directives for namespaces.

  * `Properties` folder: Holds [development environment configuration](xref:fundamentals/environments#development-and-launchsettingsjson) in the `launchSettings.json` file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `http` profile precedes the `https` profile in the `launchSettings.json` file. When an app is run with the .NET CLI, the app runs at an HTTP endpoint because the first profile found is `http`. The profile order eases the transition of adopting HTTPS for Linux and macOS users. If you prefer to start the app with the .NET CLI without having to pass the `-lp https` or `--launch-profile https` option to the `dotnet run` command, simply place the `https` profile above the `http` profile in the file.

  * `wwwroot` folder: The [Web Root](xref:fundamentals/index#web-root) folder for the server project containing the app's public static assets.

  * `Program.cs` file: The server project's entry point that sets up the ASP.NET Core web application [host](xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host#host-definition) and contains the app's startup logic, including service registrations, configuration, logging, and request processing pipeline.
    * Services for Razor components are added by calling <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.RazorComponentsServiceCollectionExtensions.AddRazorComponents%2A>. <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServerRazorComponentsBuilderExtensions.AddInteractiveServerComponents%2A> adds services to support rendering Interactive Server components. <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.WebAssemblyRazorComponentsBuilderExtensions.AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents%2A> adds services to support rendering Interactive WebAssembly components.
    * <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.RazorComponentsEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapRazorComponents%2A> discovers available components and specifies the root component for the app (the first component loaded), which by default is the `App` component (`App.razor`). <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ServerRazorComponentsEndpointConventionBuilderExtensions.AddInteractiveServerRenderMode%2A> configures interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR) for the app. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebAssemblyRazorComponentsEndpointConventionBuilderExtensions.AddInteractiveWebAssemblyRenderMode%2A> configures the Interactive WebAssembly render mode for the app.

  * App settings files (`appsettings.Development.json`, `appsettings.json`): Provide [configuration settings](xref:blazor/fundamentals/configuration) for the server project.

* Client project (`.Client`):

  * `Pages` folder: Contains the app's routable client-side Razor components (`.razor`). The route for each page is specified using the [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive. The template includes `Counter` component (`Counter.razor`) that implements the *Counter* page.

    The component folder structure of the `.Client` project differs from the Blazor Web App's main project folder structure because the main project is a standard ASP.NET Core project. The main project must take into account other assets for ASP.NET Core projects that are unrelated to Blazor.
    
    The `.Client` project is purely a Blazor project and isn't required to integrate as much with ASP.NET Core's non-Blazor features and specifications, so it uses a less complex component folder structure. However, you're welcome to use whatever component folder structure you wish in the `.Client` project. You're free to mirror the component folder layout of the main project in the `.Client` project if you wish. Note that namespaces might require adjustments for such assets as layout files if you move components into different folders than the project template uses. 
  
  * The [Web Root](xref:fundamentals/index#web-root) folder for the client-side project containing the app's public static assets, including app settings files (`appsettings.Development.json`, `appsettings.json`) that provide [configuration settings](xref:blazor/fundamentals/configuration) for the client-side project.

  * `Program.cs` file: The client-side project's entry point that sets up the WebAssembly [host](xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host#host-definition) and contains the project's startup logic, including service registrations, configuration, logging, and request processing pipeline.

  * `_Imports.razor`: Includes common Razor directives to include in the WebAssembly-rendered app components (`.razor`), such as [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directives for namespaces.

Additional files and folders may appear in an app produced from a Blazor Web App project template when additional options are configured. For example, generating an app with ASP.NET Core Identity includes additional assets for authentication and authorization features.

* `Program.cs`: The app's entry point that sets up the WebAssembly host:
  
  * The `App` component is the root component of the app. The `App` component is specified as the `div` DOM element with an `id` of `app` (`<div id="app">Loading...</div>` in `wwwroot/index.html`) to the root component collection (`builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app")`).
  * [Services](xref:blazor/fundamentals/dependency-injection) are added and configured (for example, `builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, MyDependency>()`).

* `Pages` folder: Contains the Blazor app's routable Razor components (`.razor`). The route for each page is specified using the [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive. The template includes the following components:
  * `Counter` component (`Counter.razor`): Implements the Counter page.
  * `FetchData` component (`FetchData.razor`): Implements the Fetch data page.
  * `Index` component (`Index.razor`): Implements the Home page.
  
* `Properties` folder: Holds [development environment configuration](xref:fundamentals/environments#development-and-launchsettingsjson) in the `launchSettings.json` file.

* `Shared` folder: Contains the following shared components and stylesheets:
  * `MainLayout` component (`MainLayout.razor`): The app's [layout component](xref:blazor/components/layouts).
  * `MainLayout.razor.css`: Stylesheet for the app's main layout.
  * `NavMenu` component (`NavMenu.razor`): Implements sidebar navigation. Includes the [`NavLink` component](xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing#navlink-component) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.NavLink>), which renders navigation links to other Razor components. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.NavLink> component automatically indicates a selected state when its component is loaded, which helps the user understand which component is currently displayed.
  * `NavMenu.razor.css`: Stylesheet for the app's navigation menu.
  * `SurveyPrompt` component (`SurveyPrompt.razor`) (*ASP.NET Core 7.0 or earlier*): Blazor survey component.

* `wwwroot` folder: The [Web Root](xref:fundamentals/index#web-root) folder for the app containing the app's public static assets, including `appsettings.json` and environmental app settings files for [configuration settings](xref:blazor/fundamentals/configuration). The `index.html` webpage is the root page of the app implemented as an HTML page:
  * When any page of the app is initially requested, this page is rendered and returned in the response.
  * The page specifies where the root `App` component is rendered. The component is rendered at the location of the `div` DOM element with an `id` of `app` (`<div id="app">Loading...</div>`).

* `_Imports.razor`: Includes common Razor directives to include in the app's components (`.razor`), such as [`@using`](xref:mvc/views/razor#using) directives for namespaces.

* `App.razor`: The root component of the app that sets up client-side routing using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.Router> component. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.Router> component intercepts browser navigation and renders the page that matches the requested address.

* `Program.cs`: The app's entry point that sets up the WebAssembly host:
  
  * The `App` component is the root component of the app. The `App` component is specified as the `div` DOM element with an `id` of `app` (`<div id="app">Loading...</div>` in `wwwroot/index.html`) to the root component collection (`builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app")`).
  * [Services](xref:blazor/fundamentals/dependency-injection) are added and configured (for example, `builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, MyDependency>()`).

Additional files and folders may appear in an app produced from a Blazor WebAssembly project template when additional options are configured. For example, generating an app with ASP.NET Core Identity includes additional assets for authentication and authorization features.

## Dual Blazor Server/Blazor WebAssembly app

To create an app that can run as either a Blazor Server app or a Blazor WebAssembly app, one approach is to place all of the app logic and components into a [Razor class library (RCL)](xref:blazor/components/class-libraries) and reference the RCL from separate Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly projects. For common services whose implementations differ based on the hosting model, define the service interfaces in the RCL and implement the services in the Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly projects.
