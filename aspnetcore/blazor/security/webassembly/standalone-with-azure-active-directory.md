# Secure an ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly standalone app with Azure Active Directory

This article explains how to create a [standalone Blazor WebAssembly app](xref:blazor/hosting-models#blazor-webassembly) that uses [Azure Active Directory (AAD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) for authentication.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

Register an AAD app:

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** in the Azure portal. Select **App registrations** in the sidebar. Select the **New registration** button.
1. Provide a **Name** for the app (for example, **Blazor Standalone AAD**).
1. Choose a **Supported account types**. You may select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** for this experience.
1. Set the **Redirect URI** drop down to **Single-page application (SPA)** and provide the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:{PORT}/authentication/login-callback`. The default port for an app running on Kestrel is 5001. If the app is run on a different Kestrel port, use the app's port. For IIS Express, the randomly generated port for the app can be found in the app's properties in the **Debug** panel. Since the app doesn't exist at this point and the IIS Express port isn't known, return to this step after the app is created and update the redirect URI. A remark appears later in this topic to remind IIS Express users to update the redirect URI.
1. If you're using an [unverified publisher domain](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-configure-publisher-domain), clear the **Permissions** > **Grant admin consent to openid and offline_access permissions** checkbox. If the publisher domain is verified, this checkbox isn't present.
1. Select **Register**.

Record the following information:

* Application (client) ID (for example, `41451fa7-82d9-4673-8fa5-69eff5a761fd`)
* Directory (tenant) ID (for example, `e86c78e2-8bb4-4c41-aefd-918e0565a45e`)

In **Authentication** > **Platform configurations** > **Single-page application (SPA)**:

1. Confirm the **Redirect URI** of `https://localhost:{PORT}/authentication/login-callback` is present.
1. In the **Implicit grant** section, ensure that the checkboxes for **Access tokens** and **ID tokens** are **not** selected.
1. The remaining defaults for the app are acceptable for this experience.
1. Select the **Save** button.

Create the app in an empty folder. Replace the placeholders in the following command with the information recorded earlier and execute the command in a command shell:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new blazorwasm -au SingleOrg --client-id "{CLIENT ID}" -o {APP NAME} --tenant-id "{TENANT ID}"
```

| Placeholder   | Azure portal name       | Example                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `{APP NAME}`  | &mdash;                 | `BlazorSample`                         |
| `{CLIENT ID}` | Application (client) ID | `41451fa7-82d9-4673-8fa5-69eff5a761fd` |
| `{TENANT ID}` | Directory (tenant) ID   | `e86c78e2-8bb4-4c41-aefd-918e0565a45e` |

The output location specified with the `-o|--output` option creates a project folder if it doesn't exist and becomes part of the app's name.

> [!NOTE]
> In the Azure portal, the app's platform configuration **Redirect URI** is configured for port 5001 for apps that run on the Kestrel server with default settings.
>
> If the app is run on a random IIS Express port, the port for the app can be found in the app's properties in the **Debug** panel.
>
> If the port wasn't configured earlier with the app's known port, return to the app's registration in the Azure portal and update the redirect URI with the correct port.

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/additional-scopes-standalone-AAD.md)]

After creating the app, you should be able to:

* Log into the app using an AAD user account.
* Request access tokens for Microsoft APIs. For more information, see:
  * [Access token scopes](#access-token-scopes)
  * [Quickstart: Configure an application to expose web APIs](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis)
  * [Hosted with AAD: Access token scopes (includes guidance on AAD `App ID URI` scope formats)](xref:blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-azure-active-directory#access-token-scopes)
  * [Access token scopes for Microsoft Graph API](xref:blazor/security/webassembly/graph-api)

## Authentication package

When an app is created to use Work or School Accounts (`SingleOrg`), the app automatically receives a package reference for the [Microsoft Authentication Library](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) ([`Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal)). The package provides a set of primitives that help the app authenticate users and obtain tokens to call protected APIs.

If adding authentication to an app, manually add the [`Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal) package to the app.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/package-reference.md)]

The [`Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal) package transitively adds the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package to the app.

## Authentication service support

Support for authenticating users is registered in the service container with the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MsalWebAssemblyServiceCollectionExtensions.AddMsalAuthentication%2A> extension method provided by the [`Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal) package. This method sets up the services required for the app to interact with the Identity Provider (IP).

`Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddMsalAuthentication(options =>
{
    builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options.ProviderOptions.Authentication);
});
```

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MsalWebAssemblyServiceCollectionExtensions.AddMsalAuthentication%2A> method accepts a callback to configure the parameters required to authenticate an app. The values required for configuring the app can be obtained from the AAD configuration when you register the app.

Configuration is supplied by the `wwwroot/appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT ID}",
    "ClientId": "{CLIENT ID}",
    "ValidateAuthority": true
  }
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/e86c78e2-...-918e0565a45e",
    "ClientId": "41451fa7-82d9-4673-8fa5-69eff5a761fd",
    "ValidateAuthority": true
  }
}
```

## Access token scopes

The Blazor WebAssembly template doesn't automatically configure the app to request an access token for a secure API. To provision an access token as part of the sign-in flow, add the scope to the default access token scopes of the <xref:Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal.Models.MsalProviderOptions>:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddMsalAuthentication(options =>
{
    ...
    options.ProviderOptions.DefaultAccessTokenScopes.Add("{SCOPE URI}");
});
```

Specify additional scopes with `AdditionalScopesToConsent`:

```csharp
options.ProviderOptions.AdditionalScopesToConsent.Add("{ADDITIONAL SCOPE URI}");
```

For more information, see the following sections of the *Additional scenarios* article:

* [Request additional access tokens](xref:blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios#request-additional-access-tokens)
* [Attach tokens to outgoing requests](xref:blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios#attach-tokens-to-outgoing-requests)
