# Secure a hosted ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly app with Identity Server

This article explains how to create a [hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution](xref:blazor/hosting-models#blazor-webassembly) that uses [Duende Identity Server](https://docs.duendesoftware.com) to authenticate users and API calls.

For more information on *solutions*, see <xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln>.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Duende Software](https://duendesoftware.com/) might require you to pay a license fee for production use of Duende Identity Server. For more information, see <xref:migration/50-to-60#project-templates-use-duende-identity-server>.

> [!NOTE]
> To configure a standalone or hosted Blazor WebAssembly app to use an existing, external Identity Server instance, follow the guidance in <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/standalone-with-authentication-library>.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism:

1. Create a new project.

1. Choose the **Blazor WebAssembly App** template. Select **Next**.

1. Provide a **Project name** without using dashes (see the following WARNING). Confirm that the **Location** is correct. Select **Next**.

   > [!WARNING]
   > **Avoid using dashes (`-`) in the project name that break the formation of the OIDC app identifier.** Logic in the Blazor WebAssembly project template uses the project name for an OIDC app identifier in the solution's configuration. Pascal case (`BlazorSample`) or underscores (`Blazor_Sample`) are acceptable alternatives. For more information, see [Dashes in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly project name break OIDC security (dotnet/aspnetcore #35337)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/35337).

1. In the **Additional information** dialog, select **Individual Accounts** as the **Authentication Type** to store users within the app using ASP.NET Core's [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) system.

1. Select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox.

# [Visual Studio Code / .NET Core CLI](#tab/visual-studio-code+netcore-cli)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism in an empty folder, specify the `Individual` authentication mechanism with the `-au|--auth` option to store users within the app using ASP.NET Core's [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) system:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new blazorwasm -au Individual -ho -o {APP NAME}
```

| Placeholder  | Example        |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `{APP NAME}` | `BlazorSample` |

The output location specified with the `-o|--output` option creates a project folder if it doesn't exist and becomes part of the app's name. **Avoid using dashes (`-`) in the app name that break the formation of the OIDC app identifier (see the earlier WARNING).**

For more information, see the [`dotnet new`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command in the .NET Core Guide.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-mac)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism:

1. On the **Configure your new Blazor WebAssembly App** step, select **Individual Authentication (in-app)** from the **Authentication** drop down.

1. The app is created for individual users stored in the app with ASP.NET Core [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity).

1. Select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox.

---

## **`Server`** app configuration

The following sections describe additions to the project when authentication support is included.

### Startup class

The `Startup` class has the following additions.

* In `Program.cs`:

  * ASP.NET Core Identity:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlite(
            Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

    builder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => 
            options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
    ```

  * IdentityServer with an additional <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServerBuilderConfigurationExtensions.AddApiAuthorization%2A> helper method that sets up default ASP.NET Core conventions on top of IdentityServer:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddIdentityServer()
        .AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>();
    ```

  * Authentication with an additional <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A> helper method that configures the app to validate JWT tokens produced by IdentityServer:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication()
        .AddIdentityServerJwt();
    ```

* In `Program.cs`:

  * The IdentityServer middleware exposes the OpenID Connect (OIDC) endpoints:

    ```csharp
    app.UseIdentityServer();
    ```

  * The Authentication middleware is responsible for validating request credentials and setting the user on the request context:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthentication();
    ```

  * Authorization Middleware enables authorization capabilities:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthorization();
    ```

### Azure App Service on Linux

Specify the issuer explicitly when deploying to Azure App Service on Linux. For more information, see <xref:security/authentication/identity/spa#azure-app-service-on-linux>.

### AddApiAuthorization

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServerBuilderConfigurationExtensions.AddApiAuthorization%2A> helper method configures [Identity Server](https://docs.duendesoftware.com) for ASP.NET Core scenarios. Identity Server is a powerful and extensible framework for handling app security concerns. IdentityServer exposes unnecessary complexity for the most common scenarios. Consequently, a set of conventions and configuration options is provided that we consider a good starting point. Once your authentication needs change, the full power of IdentityServer is available to customize authentication to suit an app's requirements.

### AddIdentityServerJwt

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A> helper method configures a policy scheme for the app as the default authentication handler. The policy is configured to allow Identity to handle all requests routed to any subpath in the Identity URL space `/Identity`. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerHandler> handles all other requests. Additionally, this method:

* Registers an `{APPLICATION NAME}API` API resource with IdentityServer with a default scope of `{APPLICATION NAME}API`.
* Configures the JWT Bearer Token Middleware to validate tokens issued by IdentityServer for the app.

### WeatherForecastController

In the `WeatherForecastController` (`Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs`), the [`[Authorize]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizeAttribute) is applied to the class. The attribute indicates that the user must be authorized based on the default policy to access the resource. The default authorization policy is configured to use the default authentication scheme, which is set up by <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A>. The helper method configures <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerHandler> as the default handler for requests to the app.

### ApplicationDbContext

In the `ApplicationDbContext` (`Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`), <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext> extends <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApiAuthorization.IdentityServer.ApiAuthorizationDbContext%601> to include the schema for IdentityServer. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApiAuthorization.IdentityServer.ApiAuthorizationDbContext%601> is derived from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore.IdentityDbContext>.

To gain full control of the database schema, inherit from one of the available Identity <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext> classes and configure the context to include the Identity schema by calling `builder.ConfigurePersistedGrantContext(_operationalStoreOptions.Value)` in the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext.OnModelCreating%2A> method.

### OidcConfigurationController

In the `OidcConfigurationController` (`Controllers/OidcConfigurationController.cs`), the client endpoint is provisioned to serve OIDC parameters.

### App settings

In the app settings file (`appsettings.json`) at the project root, the `IdentityServer` section describes the list of configured clients. In the following example, there's a single client. The client name corresponds to the app name and is mapped by convention to the OAuth `ClientId` parameter. The profile indicates the app type being configured. The profile is used internally to drive conventions that simplify the configuration process for the server. <!-- There are several profiles available, as explained in the [Application profiles](#application-profiles) section. -->

```json
"IdentityServer": {
  "Clients": {
    "{APP ASSEMBLY}.Client": {
      "Profile": "IdentityServerSPA"
    }
  }
}
```

The placeholder `{APP ASSEMBLY}` is the app's assembly name (for example, `BlazorSample.Client`).

## **`Client`** app configuration

### Authentication package

When an app is created to use Individual User Accounts (`Individual`), the app automatically receives a package reference for the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package. The package provides a set of primitives that help the app authenticate users and obtain tokens to call protected APIs.

If adding authentication to an app, manually add the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package to the app.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/package-reference.md)]

### `HttpClient` configuration

In `Program.cs`, a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> (`{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI`) is configured to supply <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instances that include access tokens when making requests to the server API:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI", 
        client => client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress))
    .AddHttpMessageHandler<BaseAddressAuthorizationMessageHandler>();

builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<IHttpClientFactory>()
    .CreateClient("{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI"));
```

The placeholder `{APP ASSEMBLY}` is the app's assembly name (for example, `BlazorSample.Client`).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're configuring a Blazor WebAssembly app to use an existing Identity Server instance that isn't part of a hosted Blazor solution, change the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> base address registration from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress?displayProperty=nameWithType> (`builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress`) to the server app's API authorization endpoint URL.

### API authorization support

The support for authenticating users is plugged into the service container by the extension method provided inside the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package. This method sets up the services required by the app to interact with the existing authorization system.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthorization();
```

By default, configuration for the app is loaded by convention from `_configuration/{client-id}`. By convention, the client ID is set to the app's assembly name. This URL can be changed to point to a separate endpoint by calling the overload with options.

### Imports file

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/imports-file-hosted.md)]

### Index page

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/index-page-authentication.md)]

### App component

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/app-component.md)]

### RedirectToLogin component

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/redirecttologin-component.md)]

### LoginDisplay component

The `LoginDisplay` component (`Shared/LoginDisplay.razor`) is rendered in the `MainLayout` component (`Shared/MainLayout.razor`) and manages the following behaviors:

* For authenticated users:
  * Displays the current user name.
  * Offers a link to the user profile page in ASP.NET Core Identity.
  * Offers a button to log out of the app.
* For anonymous users:
  * Offers the option to register.
  * Offers the option to log in.

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@inject SignOutSessionStateManager SignOutManager

<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <a href="authentication/profile">Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!</a>
        <button class="nav-link btn btn-link" @onclick="BeginSignOut">
            Log out
        </button>
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <a href="authentication/register">Register</a>
        <a href="authentication/login">Log in</a>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>

@code {
    private async Task BeginSignOut(MouseEventArgs args)
    {
        await SignOutManager.SetSignOutState();
        Navigation.NavigateTo("authentication/logout");
    }
}
```

### Authentication component

### FetchData component

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/fetchdata-component.md)]

## Run the app

Run the app from the Server project. When using Visual Studio, either:

* Set the **Startup Projects** drop down list in the toolbar to the *Server API app* and select the **Run** button.
* Select the Server project in **Solution Explorer** and select the **Run** button in the toolbar or start the app from the **Debug** menu.

## Name and role claim with API authorization

### Custom user factory

In the **`Client`** app, create a custom user factory. Identity Server sends multiple roles as a JSON array in a single `role` claim. A single role is sent as a string value in the claim. The factory creates an individual `role` claim for each of the user's roles.

`CustomUserFactory.cs`:

```csharp
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.Internal;

public class CustomUserFactory
    : AccountClaimsPrincipalFactory<RemoteUserAccount>
{
    public CustomUserFactory(IAccessTokenProviderAccessor accessor)
        : base(accessor)
    {
    }

    public override async ValueTask<ClaimsPrincipal> CreateUserAsync(
        RemoteUserAccount account,
        RemoteAuthenticationUserOptions options)
    {
        var user = await base.CreateUserAsync(account, options);

        if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            var identity = (ClaimsIdentity)user.Identity;
            var roleClaims = identity.FindAll(identity.RoleClaimType).ToArray();

            if (roleClaims.Any())
            {
                foreach (var existingClaim in roleClaims)
                {
                    identity.RemoveClaim(existingClaim);
                }

                var rolesElem = account.AdditionalProperties[identity.RoleClaimType];

                if (rolesElem is JsonElement roles)
                {
                    if (roles.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Array)
                    {
                        foreach (var role in roles.EnumerateArray())
                        {
                            identity.AddClaim(new Claim(options.RoleClaim, role.GetString()));
                        }
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        identity.AddClaim(new Claim(options.RoleClaim, roles.GetString()));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return user;
    }
}
```

In the **`Client`** app, register the factory in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthorization()
    .AddAccountClaimsPrincipalFactory<CustomUserFactory>();
```

In the **`Server`** app, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityBuilder.AddRoles%2A> on the Identity builder, which adds role-related services:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;

...

services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => 
    options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
    .AddRoles<IdentityRole>()
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
```

### Configure Identity Server

Use **one** of the following approaches:

* [API authorization options](#api-authorization-options)
* [Profile Service](#profile-service)

#### API authorization options

In the **`Server`** app:

* Configure Identity Server to put the `name` and `role` claims into the ID token and access token.
* Prevent the default mapping for roles in the JWT token handler.

```csharp
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
using System.Linq;

...

services.AddIdentityServer()
    .AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>(options => {
        options.IdentityResources["openid"].UserClaims.Add("name");
        options.ApiResources.Single().UserClaims.Add("name");
        options.IdentityResources["openid"].UserClaims.Add("role");
        options.ApiResources.Single().UserClaims.Add("role");
    });

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Remove("role");
```

#### Profile Service

In the **`Server`** app, create a `ProfileService` implementation.

`ProfileService.cs`:

```csharp
using IdentityModel;
using Duende.IdentityServer.Models;
using Duende.IdentityServer.Services;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ProfileService : IProfileService
{
    public ProfileService()
    {
    }

    public async Task GetProfileDataAsync(ProfileDataRequestContext context)
    {
        var nameClaim = context.Subject.FindAll(JwtClaimTypes.Name);
        context.IssuedClaims.AddRange(nameClaim);

        var roleClaims = context.Subject.FindAll(JwtClaimTypes.Role);
        context.IssuedClaims.AddRange(roleClaims);

        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public async Task IsActiveAsync(IsActiveContext context)
    {
        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

In the **`Server`** app, register the Profile Service in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
using Duende.IdentityServer.Services;

...

builder.Services.AddTransient<IProfileService, ProfileService>();

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Remove("role");
```

### Use authorization mechanisms

In the **`Client`** app, component authorization approaches are functional at this point. Any of the authorization mechanisms in components can use a role to authorize the user:

* [`AuthorizeView` component](xref:blazor/security/index#authorizeview-component) (Example: `<AuthorizeView Roles="admin">`)
* [`[Authorize]` attribute directive](xref:blazor/security/index#authorize-attribute) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizeAttribute>) (Example: `@attribute [Authorize(Roles = "admin")]`)
* [Procedural logic](xref:blazor/security/index#procedural-logic) (Example: `if (user.IsInRole("admin")) { ... }`)

  Multiple role tests are supported:

  ```csharp
  if (user.IsInRole("admin") && user.IsInRole("developer"))
  {
      ...
  }
  ```

`User.Identity.Name` is populated in the **`Client`** app with the user's user name, which is usually their sign-in email address.

## Host in Azure App Service with a custom domain and certificate

The following guidance explains:

* How to deploy a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app with Identity Server to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) with a custom domain.
* How to create and use a TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication with browsers. Although the guidance focuses on using the certificate with a custom domain, the guidance is equally applicable to using a default Azure Apps domain, for example `contoso.azurewebsites.net`.

For this hosting scenario, do **not** use the same certificate for [Identity Server's token signing key](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v5/fundamentals/keys/) and the site's HTTPS secure communication with browsers:

* Using different certificates for these two requirements is a good security practice because it isolates private keys for each purpose.
* TLS certificates for communication with browsers is managed independently without affecting Identity Server's token signing.
* When [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) supplies a certificate to an App Service app for custom domain binding, Identity Server can't obtain the same certificate from Azure Key Vault for token signing. Although configuring Identity Server to use the same TLS certificate from a physical path is possible, placing security certificates into source control is a **poor practice and should be avoided in most scenarios**.

In the following guidance, a self-signed certificate is created in Azure Key Vault solely for Identity Server token signing. The Identity Server configuration uses the key vault certificate via the app's `CurrentUser` > `My` certificate store. Other certificates used for HTTPS traffic with custom domains are created and configured separately from the Identity Server signing certificate.

To configure an app, Azure App Service, and Azure Key Vault to host with a custom domain and HTTPS:

1. Create an [App Service plan](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans) with an plan level of `Basic B1` or higher. App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.
1. Create a PFX certificate for the site's secure browser communication (HTTPS protocol) with a common name of the site's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your organization controls (for example, `www.contoso.com`). Create the certificate with:
   * Key uses
     * Digital signature validation (`digitalSignature`)
     * Key encipherment (`keyEncipherment`)
   * Enhanced/extended key uses
     * Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
     * Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)

   To create the certificate, use one of the following approaches or any other suitable tool or online service:

   * [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal#add-a-certificate-to-key-vault)
   * [MakeCert on Windows](/windows/desktop/seccrypto/makecert)
   * [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org)

   Make note of the password, which is used later to import the certificate into Azure Key Vault.

   For more information on Azure Key Vault certificates, see [Azure Key Vault: Certificates](/azure/key-vault/certificates/).
1. Create a new Azure Key Vault or use an existing key vault in your Azure subscription.
1. In the key vault's **Certificates** area, import the PFX site certificate. Record the certificate's thumbprint, which is used in the app's configuration later.
1. In Azure Key Vault, generate a new self-signed certificate for Identity Server token signing. Give the certificate a **Certificate Name** and **Subject**. The **Subject** is specified as `CN={COMMON NAME}`, where the `{COMMON NAME}` placeholder is the certificate's common name. The common name can be any alphanumeric string. For example, `CN=IdentityServerSigning` is a valid certificate **Subject**. In **Issuance Policy** > **Advanced Policy Configuration**, use the default settings. Record the certificate's thumbprint, which is used in the app's configuration later.
1. Navigate to Azure App Service in the Azure portal and create a new App Service with the following configuration:
   * **Publish** set to `Code`.
   * **Runtime stack** set to the app's runtime.
   * For **Sku and size**, confirm that the App Service tier is `Basic B1` or higher.  App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.
1. After Azure creates the App Service, open the app's **Configuration** and add a new application setting specifying the certificate thumbprints recorded earlier. The app setting key is `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES`. Separate the certificate thumbprints in the app setting value with a comma, as the following example shows:
   * Key: `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES`
   * Value: `57443A552A46DB...D55E28D412B943565,29F43A772CB6AF...1D04F0C67F85FB0B1`

   In the Azure portal, saving app settings is a two-step process: Save the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` key-value setting, then select the **Save** button at the top of the blade.
1. Select the app's **TLS/SSL settings**. Select **Private Key Certificates (.pfx)**. Use the **Import Key Vault Certificate** process. **Use the process _twice_ to import both the site's certificate for HTTPS communication and the site's self-signed Identity Server token signing certificate.**
1. Navigate to the **Custom domains** blade. At your domain registrar's website, use the **IP address** and **Custom Domain Verification ID** to configure the domain. A typical domain configuration includes:
   * An **A Record** with a **Host** of `@` and a value of the IP address from the Azure portal.
   * A **TXT Record** with a **Host** of `asuid` and the value of the verification ID generated by Azure and provided by the Azure portal.

   Make sure that you save the changes at your domain registrar's website correctly. Some registrar websites require a two-step process to save domain records: One or more records are saved individually followed by updating the domain's registration with a separate button.
1. Return to the **Custom domains** blade in the Azure portal. Select **Add custom domain**. Select the **A Record** option. Provide the domain and select **Validate**. If the domain records are correct and propagated across the Internet, the portal allows you to select the **Add custom domain** button.

   It can take a few days for domain registration changes to propagate across Internet domain name servers (DNS) after they're processed by your domain registrar. If domain records aren't updated within three business days, confirm the records are correctly set with the domain registrar and contact their customer support.
1. In the **Custom domains** blade, the **SSL STATE** for the domain is marked `Not Secure`. Select the **Add binding** link. Select the site HTTPS certificate from the key vault for the custom domain binding.
1. In Visual Studio, open the *Server* project's app settings file (`appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Production.json`). In the Identity Server configuration, add the following `Key` section. Specify the self-signed certificate **Subject** for the `Name` key. In the following example, the certificate's common name assigned in the key vault is `IdentityServerSigning`, which yields a **Subject** of `CN=IdentityServerSigning`:

   ```json
   "IdentityServer": {

     ...

     "Key": {
       "Type": "Store",
       "StoreName": "My",
       "StoreLocation": "CurrentUser",
       "Name": "CN=IdentityServerSigning"
     }
   },
   ```

1. In Visual Studio, create an Azure App Service [publish profile](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles#publish-profiles) for the *Server* project. From the menu bar, select: **Build** > **Publish** > **New** > **Azure** > **Azure App Service** (Windows or Linux). When Visual Studio is connected to an Azure subscription, you can set the **View** of Azure resources by **Resource type**. Navigate within the **Web App** list to find the App Service for the app and select it. Select **Finish**.
1. When Visual Studio returns to the **Publish** window, the key vault and SQL Server database service dependencies are automatically detected.

   No configuration changes to the default settings are required for the key vault service.

   For testing purposes, an app's local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, which is configured by default by the Blazor template, can be deployed with the app without additional configuration. Configuring a different database for Identity Server in production is beyond the scope of this article. For more information, see the database resources in the following documentation sets:
   * [App Service](/azure/app-service/)
   * [Duende Identity Server](https://docs.duendesoftware.com)

1. Select the **Edit** link under the deployment profile name at the top of the window. Change the destination URL to the site's custom domain URL (for example, `https://www.contoso.com`). Save the settings.
1. Publish the app. Visual Studio opens a browser window and requests the site at its custom domain.

The Azure documentation contains additional detail on using Azure services and custom domains with TLS binding in App Service, including information on using CNAME records instead of A records. For more information, see the following resources:

* [App Service documentation](/azure/app-service/)
* [Tutorial: Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain)

* [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/)

We recommend using a new in-private or incognito browser window for each app test run after a change to the app, app configuration, or Azure services in the Azure portal. Lingering cookies from a previous test run can result in failed authentication or authorization when testing the site even when the site's configuration is correct. For more information on how to configure Visual Studio to open a new in-private or incognito browser window for each test run, see the [Cookies and site data](#cookies-and-site-data) section.

When App Service configuration is changed in the Azure portal, the updates generally take effect quickly but aren't instant. Sometimes, you must wait a short period for an App Service to restart in order for a configuration change to take effect.

If troubleshooting an Identity Server key-signing certificate loading problem, execute the following command in an Azure portal [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-the-kudu-service) PowerShell command shell. The command provides a list of certificates that the app can access from the `CurrentUser` > `My` certificate store. The output includes certificate subjects and thumbprints useful when debugging an app:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -path Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Recurse | Format-List DnsNameList, Subject, Thumbprint, EnhancedKeyUsageList
```

> To configure a standalone or hosted Blazor WebAssembly app to use an existing, external Identity Server instance, follow the guidance in <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/standalone-with-authentication-library>.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism:

1. Create a new project.

1. Choose the **Blazor WebAssembly App** template. Select **Next**.

1. Provide a **Project name** without using dashes (see the following WARNING). Confirm that the **Location** is correct. Select **Next**.

   > [!WARNING]
   > **Avoid using dashes (`-`) in the project name that break the formation of the OIDC app identifier.** Logic in the Blazor WebAssembly project template uses the project name for an OIDC app identifier in the solution's configuration. Pascal case (`BlazorSample`) or underscores (`Blazor_Sample`) are acceptable alternatives. For more information, see [Dashes in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly project name break OIDC security (dotnet/aspnetcore #35337)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/35337).

1. In the **Additional information** dialog, select **Individual Accounts** as the **Authentication Type** to store users within the app using ASP.NET Core's [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) system.

1. Select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox.

# [Visual Studio Code / .NET Core CLI](#tab/visual-studio-code+netcore-cli)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism in an empty folder, specify the `Individual` authentication mechanism with the `-au|--auth` option to store users within the app using ASP.NET Core's [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) system:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new blazorwasm -au Individual -ho -o {APP NAME}
```

| Placeholder  | Example        |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `{APP NAME}` | `BlazorSample` |

The output location specified with the `-o|--output` option creates a project folder if it doesn't exist and becomes part of the app's name. **Avoid using dashes (`-`) in the app name that break the formation of the OIDC app identifier (see the earlier WARNING).**

For more information, see the [`dotnet new`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command in the .NET Core Guide.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-mac)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism:

1. On the **Configure your new Blazor WebAssembly App** step, select **Individual Authentication (in-app)** from the **Authentication** drop down.

1. The app is created for individual users stored in the app with ASP.NET Core [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity).

1. Select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox.

---

## **`Server`** app configuration

The following sections describe additions to the project when authentication support is included.

### Startup class

The `Startup` class has the following additions.

* In `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

  * ASP.NET Core Identity:

    ```csharp
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlite(
            Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

    services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => 
            options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
    ```

  * IdentityServer with an additional <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServerBuilderConfigurationExtensions.AddApiAuthorization%2A> helper method that sets up default ASP.NET Core conventions on top of IdentityServer:

    ```csharp
    services.AddIdentityServer()
        .AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>();
    ```

  * Authentication with an additional <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A> helper method that configures the app to validate JWT tokens produced by IdentityServer:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication()
        .AddIdentityServerJwt();
    ```

* In `Startup.Configure`:

  * The IdentityServer middleware exposes the OpenID Connect (OIDC) endpoints:

    ```csharp
    app.UseIdentityServer();
    ```

  * The Authentication middleware is responsible for validating request credentials and setting the user on the request context:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthentication();
    ```

  * Authorization Middleware enables authorization capabilities:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthorization();
    ```

### Azure App Service on Linux

Specify the issuer explicitly when deploying to Azure App Service on Linux. For more information, see <xref:security/authentication/identity/spa#azure-app-service-on-linux>.

### AddApiAuthorization

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServerBuilderConfigurationExtensions.AddApiAuthorization%2A> helper method configures [IdentityServer](https://identityserver.io/) for ASP.NET Core scenarios. IdentityServer is a powerful and extensible framework for handling app security concerns. IdentityServer exposes unnecessary complexity for the most common scenarios. Consequently, a set of conventions and configuration options is provided that we consider a good starting point. Once your authentication needs change, the full power of IdentityServer is available to customize authentication to suit an app's requirements.

### AddIdentityServerJwt

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A> helper method configures a policy scheme for the app as the default authentication handler. The policy is configured to allow Identity to handle all requests routed to any subpath in the Identity URL space `/Identity`. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerHandler> handles all other requests. Additionally, this method:

* Registers an `{APPLICATION NAME}API` API resource with IdentityServer with a default scope of `{APPLICATION NAME}API`.
* Configures the JWT Bearer Token Middleware to validate tokens issued by IdentityServer for the app.

### WeatherForecastController

In the `WeatherForecastController` (`Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs`), the [`[Authorize]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizeAttribute) is applied to the class. The attribute indicates that the user must be authorized based on the default policy to access the resource. The default authorization policy is configured to use the default authentication scheme, which is set up by <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A>. The helper method configures <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerHandler> as the default handler for requests to the app.

### ApplicationDbContext

In the `ApplicationDbContext` (`Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`), <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext> extends <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApiAuthorization.IdentityServer.ApiAuthorizationDbContext%601> to include the schema for IdentityServer. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApiAuthorization.IdentityServer.ApiAuthorizationDbContext%601> is derived from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore.IdentityDbContext>.

To gain full control of the database schema, inherit from one of the available Identity <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext> classes and configure the context to include the Identity schema by calling `builder.ConfigurePersistedGrantContext(_operationalStoreOptions.Value)` in the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext.OnModelCreating%2A> method.

### OidcConfigurationController

In the `OidcConfigurationController` (`Controllers/OidcConfigurationController.cs`), the client endpoint is provisioned to serve OIDC parameters.

### App settings

In the app settings file (`appsettings.json`) at the project root, the `IdentityServer` section describes the list of configured clients. In the following example, there's a single client. The client name corresponds to the app name and is mapped by convention to the OAuth `ClientId` parameter. The profile indicates the app type being configured. The profile is used internally to drive conventions that simplify the configuration process for the server. <!-- There are several profiles available, as explained in the [Application profiles](#application-profiles) section. -->

```json
"IdentityServer": {
  "Clients": {
    "{APP ASSEMBLY}.Client": {
      "Profile": "IdentityServerSPA"
    }
  }
}
```

The placeholder `{APP ASSEMBLY}` is the app's assembly name (for example, `BlazorSample.Client`).

## **`Client`** app configuration

### Authentication package

When an app is created to use Individual User Accounts (`Individual`), the app automatically receives a package reference for the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package. The package provides a set of primitives that help the app authenticate users and obtain tokens to call protected APIs.

If adding authentication to an app, manually add the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package to the app.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/package-reference.md)]

### `HttpClient` configuration

In `Program.cs`, a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> (`{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI`) is configured to supply <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instances that include access tokens when making requests to the server API:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI", 
        client => client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress))
    .AddHttpMessageHandler<BaseAddressAuthorizationMessageHandler>();

builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<IHttpClientFactory>()
    .CreateClient("{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI"));
```

The placeholder `{APP ASSEMBLY}` is the app's assembly name (for example, `BlazorSample.Client`).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're configuring a Blazor WebAssembly app to use an existing Identity Server instance that isn't part of a hosted Blazor solution, change the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> base address registration from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress?displayProperty=nameWithType> (`builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress`) to the server app's API authorization endpoint URL.

### API authorization support

The support for authenticating users is plugged into the service container by the extension method provided inside the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package. This method sets up the services required by the app to interact with the existing authorization system.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthorization();
```

By default, configuration for the app is loaded by convention from `_configuration/{client-id}`. By convention, the client ID is set to the app's assembly name. This URL can be changed to point to a separate endpoint by calling the overload with options.

### Imports file

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/imports-file-hosted.md)]

### Index page

### App component

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/app-component.md)]

### RedirectToLogin component

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/redirecttologin-component.md)]

### LoginDisplay component

The `LoginDisplay` component (`Shared/LoginDisplay.razor`) is rendered in the `MainLayout` component (`Shared/MainLayout.razor`) and manages the following behaviors:

* For authenticated users:
  * Displays the current user name.
  * Offers a link to the user profile page in ASP.NET Core Identity.
  * Offers a button to log out of the app.
* For anonymous users:
  * Offers the option to register.
  * Offers the option to log in.

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@inject SignOutSessionStateManager SignOutManager

<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <a href="authentication/profile">Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!</a>
        <button class="nav-link btn btn-link" @onclick="BeginSignOut">
            Log out

    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <a href="authentication/register">Register</a>
        <a href="authentication/login">Log in</a>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>

@code {
    private async Task BeginSignOut(MouseEventArgs args)
    {
        await SignOutManager.SetSignOutState();
        Navigation.NavigateTo("authentication/logout");
    }
}
```

### Authentication component

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/authentication-component.md)]

### FetchData component

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/security/includes/fetchdata-component.md)]

## Run the app

Run the app from the Server project. When using Visual Studio, either:

* Set the **Startup Projects** drop down list in the toolbar to the *Server API app* and select the **Run** button.
* Select the Server project in **Solution Explorer** and select the **Run** button in the toolbar or start the app from the **Debug** menu.

## Name and role claim with API authorization

### Custom user factory

In the **`Client`** app, create a custom user factory. Identity Server sends multiple roles as a JSON array in a single `role` claim. A single role is sent as a string value in the claim. The factory creates an individual `role` claim for each of the user's roles.

`CustomUserFactory.cs`:

```csharp
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.Internal;

public class CustomUserFactory
    : AccountClaimsPrincipalFactory<RemoteUserAccount>
{
    public CustomUserFactory(IAccessTokenProviderAccessor accessor)
        : base(accessor)
    {
    }

    public override async ValueTask<ClaimsPrincipal> CreateUserAsync(
        RemoteUserAccount account,
        RemoteAuthenticationUserOptions options)
    {
        var user = await base.CreateUserAsync(account, options);

        if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            var identity = (ClaimsIdentity)user.Identity;
            var roleClaims = identity.FindAll(identity.RoleClaimType).ToArray();

            if (roleClaims.Any())
            {
                foreach (var existingClaim in roleClaims)
                {
                    identity.RemoveClaim(existingClaim);
                }

                var rolesElem = account.AdditionalProperties[identity.RoleClaimType];

                if (rolesElem is JsonElement roles)
                {
                    if (roles.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Array)
                    {
                        foreach (var role in roles.EnumerateArray())
                        {
                            identity.AddClaim(new Claim(options.RoleClaim, role.GetString()));
                        }
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        identity.AddClaim(new Claim(options.RoleClaim, roles.GetString()));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return user;
    }
}
```

In the **`Client`** app, register the factory in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthorization()
    .AddAccountClaimsPrincipalFactory<CustomUserFactory>();
```

In the **`Server`** app, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityBuilder.AddRoles%2A> on the Identity builder, which adds role-related services:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;

...

services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => 
    options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
    .AddRoles<IdentityRole>()
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
```

### Configure Identity Server

Use **one** of the following approaches:

* [API authorization options](#api-authorization-options)
* [Profile Service](#profile-service)

#### API authorization options

In the **`Server`** app:

* Configure Identity Server to put the `name` and `role` claims into the ID token and access token.
* Prevent the default mapping for roles in the JWT token handler.

```csharp
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
using System.Linq;

...

services.AddIdentityServer()
    .AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>(options => {
        options.IdentityResources["openid"].UserClaims.Add("name");
        options.ApiResources.Single().UserClaims.Add("name");
        options.IdentityResources["openid"].UserClaims.Add("role");
        options.ApiResources.Single().UserClaims.Add("role");
    });

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Remove("role");
```

#### Profile Service

In the **`Server`** app, create a `ProfileService` implementation.

`ProfileService.cs`:

```csharp
using IdentityModel;
using IdentityServer4.Models;
using IdentityServer4.Services;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ProfileService : IProfileService
{
    public ProfileService()
    {
    }

    public async Task GetProfileDataAsync(ProfileDataRequestContext context)
    {
        var nameClaim = context.Subject.FindAll(JwtClaimTypes.Name);
        context.IssuedClaims.AddRange(nameClaim);

        var roleClaims = context.Subject.FindAll(JwtClaimTypes.Role);
        context.IssuedClaims.AddRange(roleClaims);

        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public async Task IsActiveAsync(IsActiveContext context)
    {
        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

In the **`Server`** app, register the Profile Service in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
using IdentityServer4.Services;

...

services.AddTransient<IProfileService, ProfileService>();

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Remove("role");
```

### Use authorization mechanisms

In the **`Client`** app, component authorization approaches are functional at this point. Any of the authorization mechanisms in components can use a role to authorize the user:

* [`AuthorizeView` component](xref:blazor/security/index#authorizeview-component) (Example: `<AuthorizeView Roles="admin">`)
* [`[Authorize]` attribute directive](xref:blazor/security/index#authorize-attribute) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizeAttribute>) (Example: `@attribute [Authorize(Roles = "admin")]`)
* [Procedural logic](xref:blazor/security/index#procedural-logic) (Example: `if (user.IsInRole("admin")) { ... }`)

  Multiple role tests are supported:

  ```csharp
  if (user.IsInRole("admin") && user.IsInRole("developer"))
  {
      ...
  }
  ```

`User.Identity.Name` is populated in the **`Client`** app with the user's user name, which is usually their sign-in email address.

## Token signing scenarios with Azure App Service

Two scenarios are covered. Follow the guidance in either **one** of the following sections:

* [Host in Azure App Service with automatic token signing and Data Protection key security using Azure Key Vault](#host-in-azure-app-service-with-automatic-token-signing-and-data-protection-key-security-using-azure-key-vault)
* [Host in Azure App Service with certificate token signing](#host-in-azure-app-service-with-certificate-token-signing)

### Host in Azure App Service with automatic token signing and Data Protection key security using Azure Key Vault

The guidance in this section explains:

* How to deploy a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app with Identity Server to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/).
* How to use automatic Identity Server token signing with Data Protection keys secured by Azure Key Vault.

> [!NOTE]
> To create and deploy a TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication after following the guidance in this section, see the [Use a custom domain and TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication in Azure App Service](#use-a-custom-domain-and-tls-certificate-for-https-protocol-communication-in-azure-app-service) section of this article.

1. Create an [App Service plan](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans).

   > [!NOTE]
   > An App Service plan with an plan level of `Basic B1` or higher tier is required if you also plan to use one or more custom domains with the app.

1. Create a new Azure Key Vault or use an existing key vault in your Azure subscription.

1. Navigate to Azure App Service in the Azure portal and create a new App Service with the following configuration:

   * **Publish** set to `Code`.
   * **Runtime stack** set to the app's runtime.
   * For **Sku and size**, confirm that the App Service tier is `Basic B1` or higher if you also plan to use a custom domain. App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.

1. Configure the app to use automatic token signing and Azure Key Vault to store and protect ASP.NET Core Data Protection keys:

   Identity Server token signing is automatic by default. Identity Server also uses ASP.NET Core Data Protection by default. No configuration in the app is required for these features. For more information, see [Automatic key management (Duende Software documentation)](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v5/fundamentals/keys/#automatic-key-management).

   The app requires configuration to use Azure Key Vault to store and protect the keys used for ASP.NET Core Data Protection. Use the guidance in the following ASP.NET Core documentation resources to configure the required features:

   * [Persist keys to Azure Blob Storage](xref:security/data-protection/implementation/key-storage-providers#azure-storage)
   * [Configure Data Protection: ProtectKeysWithAzureKeyVault](xref:security/data-protection/configuration/overview#protectkeyswithazurekeyvault)

1. In Visual Studio, create an Azure App Service [publish profile](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles#publish-profiles) for the *Server* project. From the menu bar, select: **Build** > **Publish** > **New** > **Azure** > **Azure App Service** (Windows or Linux). When Visual Studio is connected to an Azure subscription, you can set the **View** of Azure resources by **Resource type**. Navigate within the **Web App** list to find the App Service for the app and select it. Select **Finish**.
1. When Visual Studio returns to the **Publish** window, the key vault and SQL Server database service dependencies are automatically detected.

   No configuration changes to the default settings are required for the key vault service.

   For testing purposes, an app's local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, which is configured by default by the Blazor template, can be deployed with the app without additional configuration. Configuring a different database for Identity Server in production is beyond the scope of this article. For more information, see the database resources in the following documentation sets:

   * [App Service](/azure/app-service/)
   * [Identity Server](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v5/overview/)

1. Publish the app. Visual Studio opens a browser window and requests the site.

The Azure documentation contains additional detail on using Azure services. See the following resources:

* [App Service documentation](/azure/app-service/)
* [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/)

We recommend using a new in-private or incognito browser window for each app test run after a change to the app, app configuration, or Azure services in the Azure portal. Lingering cookies from a previous test run can result in failed authentication or authorization when testing the site even when the site's configuration is correct. For more information on how to configure Visual Studio to open a new in-private or incognito browser window for each test run, see the [Cookies and site data](#cookies-and-site-data) section.

When App Service configuration is changed in the Azure portal, the updates generally take effect quickly but aren't instant. Sometimes, you must wait a short period for an App Service to restart in order for a configuration change to take effect.

### Host in Azure App Service with certificate token signing

The guidance in this section explains:

* How to deploy a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app with Identity Server to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/).
* How to create and use a TLS certificate for Identity Server token signing.

> [!NOTE]
> To create and deploy a TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication after following the guidance in this section, see the [Use a custom domain and TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication in Azure App Service](#use-a-custom-domain-and-tls-certificate-for-https-protocol-communication-in-azure-app-service) section of this article.

In the following guidance, a self-signed certificate is created in Azure Key Vault solely for Identity Server token signing. The Identity Server configuration uses the key vault certificate following different approaches for **Windows** App Service and **Linux** App Service:

* **Windows** App Service: The app's `CurrentUser` > `My` certificate store is accessed by the app to load the certificate.
* **Linux** App Service: The app loads the certificate manually.

> [!WARNING]
> When seeking to use a certificate for Identity Server token signing and a custom domain, do **not** use the same certificate for Identity Server's token signing and the site's HTTPS secure communication with browsers:
>
> * Using different certificates for these two requirements is a good security practice because it isolates private keys for each purpose.
> * TLS certificates for communication with browsers is managed independently without affecting Identity Server's token signing.
> * When [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) supplies a certificate to an App Service app for custom domain binding, Identity Server can't obtain the same certificate from Azure Key Vault for token signing. Although configuring Identity Server to use the same TLS certificate from a physical path is possible, placing security certificates into source control is a poor practice and should be avoided in most scenarios.

To configure an app, Azure App Service, and Azure Key Vault to host with a custom token signing certificate:

1. Create an [App Service plan](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans).

   > [!NOTE]
   > An App Service plan with an plan level of `Basic B1` or higher tier is required if you also plan to use one or more custom domains with the app.

1. Create a new Azure Key Vault or use an existing key vault in your Azure subscription.

1. In Azure Key Vault, generate a new self-signed certificate for Identity Server token signing. Give the certificate a **Certificate Name** and **Subject**. The **Subject** is specified as `CN={COMMON NAME}`, where the `{COMMON NAME}` placeholder is the certificate's common name. The common name can be any alphanumeric string. For example, `CN=IdentityServerSigning` is a valid certificate **Subject**. In **Issuance Policy** > **Advanced Policy Configuration**, use the default settings.

   To create the certificate, use one of the following approaches or any other suitable tool or online service:

   * [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal#add-a-certificate-to-key-vault)
   * [MakeCert on Windows](/windows/desktop/seccrypto/makecert)
   * [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org)

   Record the certificate's thumbprint, which is used in the app's configuration later.

   For more information on Azure Key Vault certificates, see [Azure Key Vault: Certificates](/azure/key-vault/certificates/).

1. Navigate to Azure App Service in the Azure portal and create a new App Service with the following configuration:

   * **Publish** set to `Code`.
   * **Runtime stack** set to the app's runtime.
   * For **Sku and size**, confirm that the App Service tier is `Basic B1` or higher.  App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.

1. After Azure creates the App Service, open the app's **Configuration** and add a new application setting specifying the certificate thumbprint recorded earlier. The app setting key is `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES`:

   * Key: `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES`
   * Value: `57443A552A46DB...D55E28D412B943565`

   In the Azure portal, saving app settings is a two-step process: Save the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` key-value setting, then select the **Save** button at the top of the blade.

1. Select the app's **TLS/SSL settings**. Select **Private Key Certificates (.pfx)**. Use the **Import Key Vault Certificate** process to import the site's self-signed Identity Server token signing certificate.

1. Configure the app to use the token signing certificate based on your choice of host OS, either Windows App Service or Linux App Service:

   **Windows App Service**

   In Visual Studio, open the *Server* project's app settings file (`appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Production.json`). In the Identity Server configuration, add the following `Key` section. Specify the self-signed certificate **Subject** for the `Name` key. In the following example, the certificate's common name assigned in the key vault is `IdentityServerSigning`, which yields a **Subject** of `CN=IdentityServerSigning`:

   ```json
   "IdentityServer": {

     ...

     "Key": {
       "Type": "Store",
       "StoreName": "My",
       "StoreLocation": "CurrentUser",
       "Name": "CN=IdentityServerSigning"
     }
   },
   ```

   If troubleshooting an Identity Server key-signing certificate loading problem, execute the following command in an Azure portal [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-the-kudu-service) PowerShell command shell. The command provides a list of certificates that the app can access from the `CurrentUser` > `My` certificate store. The output includes certificate subjects and thumbprints useful when debugging an app:

   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -path Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Recurse | Format-List DnsNameList, Subject, Thumbprint, EnhancedKeyUsageList
   ```

   **Linux App Service**

   Linux can't use a Windows certificate store to load a TLS certificate. On Linux App Service, certificates are placed at the path `/var/ssl/private/`. Manually load and use the certificate from the preceding path.

   If the following namespaces aren't already present at the top of `Startup.cs` in the **Server** project, add them to the file:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.IO;
   using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
   ```

   In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, update the Identity Server configuration to use a manually-loaded certificate. In the following example, the `{THUMBPRINT}` placeholder is the certificate's thumbprint:

   ```csharp
   var certPath = "/var/ssl/private/{THUMBPRINT}.p12";

   if (File.Exists(certPath))
   {
       var bytes = File.ReadAllBytes(certPath);
       var certificate = new X509Certificate2(bytes);

       services.AddIdentityServer()
           .AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>(options => { })
           .AddSigningCredential(certificate);
   }
   else
   {
       throw new FileNotFoundException($"Certificate path: {certPath}.");
   }
   ```

1. In Visual Studio, create an Azure App Service [publish profile](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles#publish-profiles) for the *Server* project. From the menu bar, select: **Build** > **Publish** > **New** > **Azure** > **Azure App Service** (Windows or Linux). When Visual Studio is connected to an Azure subscription, you can set the **View** of Azure resources by **Resource type**. Navigate within the **Web App** list to find the App Service for the app and select it. Select **Finish**.

1. When Visual Studio returns to the **Publish** window, the key vault and SQL Server database service dependencies are automatically detected.

   No configuration changes to the default settings are required for the key vault service.

   For testing purposes, an app's local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, which is configured by default by the Blazor template, can be deployed with the app without additional configuration. Configuring a different database for Identity Server in production is beyond the scope of this article. For more information, see the database resources in the following documentation sets:

   * [App Service](/azure/app-service/)
   * [Identity Server](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v5/overview/)

1. Publish the app. Visual Studio opens a browser window and requests the site.

The Azure documentation contains additional detail on using Azure services. See the following resources:

* [App Service documentation](/azure/app-service/)
* [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/)

We recommend using a new in-private or incognito browser window for each app test run after a change to the app, app configuration, or Azure services in the Azure portal. Lingering cookies from a previous test run can result in failed authentication or authorization when testing the site even when the site's configuration is correct. For more information on how to configure Visual Studio to open a new in-private or incognito browser window for each test run, see the [Cookies and site data](#cookies-and-site-data) section.

When App Service configuration is changed in the Azure portal, the updates generally take effect quickly but aren't instant. Sometimes, you must wait a short period for an App Service to restart in order for a configuration change to take effect.

## Use a custom domain and TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication in Azure App Service

The guidance in this section explains how to create and use a TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication with browsers for an app that has been deployed to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/). Although the guidance focuses on using the certificate with a custom domain, the guidance is equally applicable to using a default Azure Apps domain, for example, `contoso.azurewebsites.net`.

> [!NOTE]
> The guidance in this section assumes that the app is already hosted in Azure App Service. If deploying to App Service for the first time, follow the guidance in the [Token signing scenarios with Azure App Service](#token-signing-scenarios-with-azure-app-service) section before using the guidance in this section.

To configure an app, Azure App Service, and Azure Key Vault to host with a custom domain and HTTPS:

1. Use an [App Service plan](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans) with an plan level of `Basic B1` or higher. App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.

1. Create a PFX certificate for the site's secure browser communication (HTTPS protocol) with a common name of the site's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your organization controls (for example, `www.contoso.com`). Create the certificate with:

   * Key uses
     * Digital signature validation (`digitalSignature`)
     * Key encipherment (`keyEncipherment`)
   * Enhanced/extended key uses
     * Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
     * Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)

   To create the certificate, use one of the following approaches or any other suitable tool or online service:

   * [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal#add-a-certificate-to-key-vault)
   * [MakeCert on Windows](/windows/desktop/seccrypto/makecert)
   * [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org)

   Make note of the password, which is used later to import the certificate into Azure Key Vault.

   For more information on Azure Key Vault certificates, see [Azure Key Vault: Certificates](/azure/key-vault/certificates/).

1. Create a new Azure Key Vault or use an existing key vault in your Azure subscription.

1. In the key vault's **Certificates** area, import the PFX site certificate. Record the certificate's thumbprint, which is used in the app's configuration later.

1. In Azure App Service in the Azure portal for **Sku and size**, confirm that the App Service tier is `Basic B1` or higher. App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.

1. Open the app's **Configuration** in App Service and add a new application setting with a key of `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` (if it doesn't already exist) or modify the existing `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` application setting. Specify the certificate thumbprint of the TLS certificate recorded earlier:

   * When using automatic token signing, there is only a single thumbprint for the HTTPS communication. Example key: `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` Example value: `57443A552A46DB...D55E28D412B943565`
   * When using a separate token signing certificate, there are two thumbprints for the setting with thumbprint values separated by a comma. Example key: `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` Example value: `57443A552A46DB...D55E28D412B943565,29F43A772CB6AF...1D04F0C67F85FB0B1`

   In the Azure portal, saving app settings is a two-step process: Save the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` key-value setting, then select the **Save** button at the top of the blade.

1. Select the app's **TLS/SSL settings**. Select **Private Key Certificates (.pfx)**. Use the **Import Key Vault Certificate** process to import the site's certificate for HTTPS communication. **If two certificates are used by the app, one for using a custom domain and one for Identity Server key signing, both certificates must be imported from Azure Key Vault using this process.**

1. Navigate to the **Custom domains** blade. At your domain registrar's website, use the **IP address** and **Custom Domain Verification ID** to configure the domain. A typical domain configuration includes:

   * An **A Record** with a **Host** of `@` and a value of the IP address from the Azure portal.
   * A **TXT Record** with a **Host** of `asuid` and the value of the verification ID generated by Azure and provided by the Azure portal.

   Make sure that you save the changes at your domain registrar's website correctly. Some registrar websites require a two-step process to save domain records: One or more records are saved individually followed by updating the domain's registration with a separate button.

1. Return to the **Custom domains** blade in the Azure portal. Select **Add custom domain**. Select the **A Record** option. Provide the domain and select **Validate**. If the domain records are correct and propagated across the Internet, the portal allows you to select the **Add custom domain** button.

   It can take a few days for domain registration changes to propagate across Internet domain name servers (DNS) after they're processed by your domain registrar. If domain records aren't updated within three business days, confirm the records are correctly set with the domain registrar and contact their customer support.

1. In the **Custom domains** blade, the **SSL STATE** for the domain is marked `Not Secure`. Select the **Add binding** link. Select the site HTTPS certificate from the key vault for the custom domain binding.

The Azure documentation contains additional detail on using Azure services and custom domains with TLS binding in App Service, including information on using CNAME records instead of A records. For more information, see the following resources:

* [App Service documentation](/azure/app-service/)
* [Tutorial: Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain)
* [Secure a custom DNS name with a TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings)
* [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/)

We recommend using a new in-private or incognito browser window for each app test run after a change to the app, app configuration, or Azure services in the Azure portal. Lingering cookies from a previous test run can result in failed authentication or authorization when testing the site even when the site's configuration is correct. For more information on how to configure Visual Studio to open a new in-private or incognito browser window for each test run, see the [Cookies and site data](#cookies-and-site-data) section.

When App Service configuration is changed in the Azure portal, the updates generally take effect quickly but aren't instant. Sometimes, you must wait a short period for an App Service to restart in order for a configuration change to take effect.

If troubleshooting an Identity Server key-signing certificate loading problem, execute the following command in an Azure portal [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-the-kudu-service) PowerShell command shell. The command provides a list of certificates that the app can access from the `CurrentUser` > `My` certificate store. The output includes certificate subjects and thumbprints useful when debugging an app:

```powershell

> [!NOTE]
> To configure a standalone or hosted Blazor WebAssembly app to use an existing, external Identity Server instance, follow the guidance in <xref:blazor/security/webassembly/standalone-with-authentication-library>.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism:

1. Create a new project.

1. Choose the **Blazor WebAssembly App** template. Select **Next**.

1. Provide a **Project name** without using dashes (see the following WARNING). Confirm that the **Location** is correct. Select **Next**.

   > [!WARNING]
   > **Avoid using dashes (`-`) in the project name that break the formation of the OIDC app identifier.** Logic in the Blazor WebAssembly project template uses the project name for an OIDC app identifier in the solution's configuration. Pascal case (`BlazorSample`) or underscores (`Blazor_Sample`) are acceptable alternatives. For more information, see [Dashes in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly project name break OIDC security (dotnet/aspnetcore #35337)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/35337).

1. In the **Additional information** dialog, select **Individual Accounts** as the **Authentication Type** to store users within the app using ASP.NET Core's [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) system.

1. Select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox.

# [Visual Studio Code / .NET Core CLI](#tab/visual-studio-code+netcore-cli)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism in an empty folder, specify the `Individual` authentication mechanism with the `-au|--auth` option to store users within the app using ASP.NET Core's [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) system:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new blazorwasm -au Individual -ho -o {APP NAME}
```

| Placeholder  | Example        |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `{APP NAME}` | `BlazorSample` |

The output location specified with the `-o|--output` option creates a project folder if it doesn't exist and becomes part of the app's name. **Avoid using dashes (`-`) in the app name that break the formation of the OIDC app identifier (see the earlier WARNING).**

For more information, see the [`dotnet new`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command in the .NET Core Guide.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-mac)

To create a new Blazor WebAssembly project with an authentication mechanism:

1. On the **Configure your new Blazor WebAssembly App** step, select **Individual Authentication (in-app)** from the **Authentication** drop down.

1. The app is created for individual users stored in the app with ASP.NET Core [Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity).

1. Select the **ASP.NET Core hosted** checkbox.

---

## **`Server`** app configuration

The following sections describe additions to the project when authentication support is included.

### Startup class

The `Startup` class has the following additions.

* In `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

  * ASP.NET Core Identity:

    ```csharp
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlite(
            Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

    services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => 
            options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
    ```

  * IdentityServer with an additional <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServerBuilderConfigurationExtensions.AddApiAuthorization%2A> helper method that sets up default ASP.NET Core conventions on top of IdentityServer:

    ```csharp
    services.AddIdentityServer()
        .AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>();
    ```

  * Authentication with an additional <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A> helper method that configures the app to validate JWT tokens produced by IdentityServer:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication()
        .AddIdentityServerJwt();
    ```

* In `Startup.Configure`:

  * The IdentityServer middleware exposes the OpenID Connect (OIDC) endpoints:

    ```csharp
    app.UseIdentityServer();
    ```

  * The Authentication middleware is responsible for validating request credentials and setting the user on the request context:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthentication();
    ```

  * Authorization Middleware enables authorization capabilities:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthorization();
    ```

### Azure App Service on Linux

Specify the issuer explicitly when deploying to Azure App Service on Linux. For more information, see <xref:security/authentication/identity/spa#azure-app-service-on-linux>.

### AddApiAuthorization

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServerBuilderConfigurationExtensions.AddApiAuthorization%2A> helper method configures [IdentityServer](https://identityserver.io/) for ASP.NET Core scenarios. IdentityServer is a powerful and extensible framework for handling app security concerns. IdentityServer exposes unnecessary complexity for the most common scenarios. Consequently, a set of conventions and configuration options is provided that we consider a good starting point. Once your authentication needs change, the full power of IdentityServer is available to customize authentication to suit an app's requirements.

### AddIdentityServerJwt

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A> helper method configures a policy scheme for the app as the default authentication handler. The policy is configured to allow Identity to handle all requests routed to any subpath in the Identity URL space `/Identity`. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerHandler> handles all other requests. Additionally, this method:

* Registers an `{APPLICATION NAME}API` API resource with IdentityServer with a default scope of `{APPLICATION NAME}API`.
* Configures the JWT Bearer Token Middleware to validate tokens issued by IdentityServer for the app.

### WeatherForecastController

In the `WeatherForecastController` (`Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs`), the [`[Authorize]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizeAttribute) is applied to the class. The attribute indicates that the user must be authorized based on the default policy to access the resource. The default authorization policy is configured to use the default authentication scheme, which is set up by <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilderExtensions.AddIdentityServerJwt%2A>. The helper method configures <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerHandler> as the default handler for requests to the app.

### ApplicationDbContext

In the `ApplicationDbContext` (`Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`), <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext> extends <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApiAuthorization.IdentityServer.ApiAuthorizationDbContext%601> to include the schema for IdentityServer. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.ApiAuthorization.IdentityServer.ApiAuthorizationDbContext%601> is derived from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore.IdentityDbContext>.

To gain full control of the database schema, inherit from one of the available Identity <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext> classes and configure the context to include the Identity schema by calling `builder.ConfigurePersistedGrantContext(_operationalStoreOptions.Value)` in the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext.OnModelCreating%2A> method.

### OidcConfigurationController

In the `OidcConfigurationController` (`Controllers/OidcConfigurationController.cs`), the client endpoint is provisioned to serve OIDC parameters.

### App settings

In the app settings file (`appsettings.json`) at the project root, the `IdentityServer` section describes the list of configured clients. In the following example, there's a single client. The client name corresponds to the app name and is mapped by convention to the OAuth `ClientId` parameter. The profile indicates the app type being configured. The profile is used internally to drive conventions that simplify the configuration process for the server. <!-- There are several profiles available, as explained in the [Application profiles](#application-profiles) section. -->

```json
"IdentityServer": {
  "Clients": {
    "{APP ASSEMBLY}.Client": {
      "Profile": "IdentityServerSPA"
    }
  }
}
```

The placeholder `{APP ASSEMBLY}` is the app's assembly name (for example, `BlazorSample.Client`).

## **`Client`** app configuration

### Authentication package

When an app is created to use Individual User Accounts (`Individual`), the app automatically receives a package reference for the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package. The package provides a set of primitives that help the app authenticate users and obtain tokens to call protected APIs.

If adding authentication to an app, manually add the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package to the app.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/package-reference.md)]

### `HttpClient` configuration

In `Program.cs`, a named <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> (`{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI`) is configured to supply <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> instances that include access tokens when making requests to the server API:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI", 
        client => client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress))
    .AddHttpMessageHandler<BaseAddressAuthorizationMessageHandler>();

builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<IHttpClientFactory>()
    .CreateClient("{APP ASSEMBLY}.ServerAPI"));
```

The placeholder `{APP ASSEMBLY}` is the app's assembly name (for example, `BlazorSample.Client`).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're configuring a Blazor WebAssembly app to use an existing Identity Server instance that isn't part of a hosted Blazor solution, change the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> base address registration from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress?displayProperty=nameWithType> (`builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress`) to the server app's API authorization endpoint URL.

### API authorization support

The support for authenticating users is plugged into the service container by the extension method provided inside the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication) package. This method sets up the services required by the app to interact with the existing authorization system.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthorization();
```

By default, configuration for the app is loaded by convention from `_configuration/{client-id}`. By convention, the client ID is set to the app's assembly name. This URL can be changed to point to a separate endpoint by calling the overload with options.

* For authenticated users:
  * Displays the current user name.
  * Offers a link to the user profile page in ASP.NET Core Identity.
  * Offers a button to log out of the app.
* For anonymous users:
  * Offers the option to register.
  * Offers the option to log in.

## Run the app

Run the app from the Server project. When using Visual Studio, either:

* Set the **Startup Projects** drop down list in the toolbar to the *Server API app* and select the **Run** button.
* Select the Server project in **Solution Explorer** and select the **Run** button in the toolbar or start the app from the **Debug** menu.

## Name and role claim with API authorization

### Custom user factory

In the **`Client`** app, create a custom user factory. Identity Server sends multiple roles as a JSON array in a single `role` claim. A single role is sent as a string value in the claim. The factory creates an individual `role` claim for each of the user's roles.

`CustomUserFactory.cs`:

```csharp
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.Internal;

public class CustomUserFactory
    : AccountClaimsPrincipalFactory<RemoteUserAccount>
{
    public CustomUserFactory(IAccessTokenProviderAccessor accessor)
        : base(accessor)
    {
    }

    public override async ValueTask<ClaimsPrincipal> CreateUserAsync(
        RemoteUserAccount account,
        RemoteAuthenticationUserOptions options)
    {
        var user = await base.CreateUserAsync(account, options);

        if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            var identity = (ClaimsIdentity)user.Identity;
            var roleClaims = identity.FindAll(identity.RoleClaimType).ToArray();

            if (roleClaims.Any())
            {
                foreach (var existingClaim in roleClaims)
                {
                    identity.RemoveClaim(existingClaim);
                }

                var rolesElem = account.AdditionalProperties[identity.RoleClaimType];

                if (rolesElem is JsonElement roles)
                {
                    if (roles.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Array)
                    {
                        foreach (var role in roles.EnumerateArray())
                        {
                            identity.AddClaim(new Claim(options.RoleClaim, role.GetString()));
                        }
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        identity.AddClaim(new Claim(options.RoleClaim, roles.GetString()));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return user;
    }
}
```

In the **`Client`** app, register the factory in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthorization()
    .AddAccountClaimsPrincipalFactory<CustomUserFactory>();
```

In the **`Server`** app, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityBuilder.AddRoles%2A> on the Identity builder, which adds role-related services:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;

...

services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => 
    options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
    .AddRoles<IdentityRole>()
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
```

### Configure Identity Server

Use **one** of the following approaches:

* [API authorization options](#api-authorization-options)
* [Profile Service](#profile-service)

#### API authorization options

In the **`Server`** app:

* Configure Identity Server to put the `name` and `role` claims into the ID token and access token.
* Prevent the default mapping for roles in the JWT token handler.

```csharp
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
using System.Linq;

...

services.AddIdentityServer()
    .AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>(options => {
        options.IdentityResources["openid"].UserClaims.Add("name");
        options.ApiResources.Single().UserClaims.Add("name");
        options.IdentityResources["openid"].UserClaims.Add("role");
        options.ApiResources.Single().UserClaims.Add("role");
    });

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Remove("role");
```

#### Profile Service

In the **`Server`** app, create a `ProfileService` implementation.

`ProfileService.cs`:

```csharp
using IdentityModel;
using IdentityServer4.Models;
using IdentityServer4.Services;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ProfileService : IProfileService
{
    public ProfileService()
    {
    }

    public async Task GetProfileDataAsync(ProfileDataRequestContext context)
    {
        var nameClaim = context.Subject.FindAll(JwtClaimTypes.Name);
        context.IssuedClaims.AddRange(nameClaim);

        var roleClaims = context.Subject.FindAll(JwtClaimTypes.Role);
        context.IssuedClaims.AddRange(roleClaims);

        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public async Task IsActiveAsync(IsActiveContext context)
    {
        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

In the **`Server`** app, register the Profile Service in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
using IdentityServer4.Services;

...

services.AddTransient<IProfileService, ProfileService>();

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Remove("role");
```

### Use authorization mechanisms

In the **`Client`** app, component authorization approaches are functional at this point. Any of the authorization mechanisms in components can use a role to authorize the user:

* [`AuthorizeView` component](xref:blazor/security/index#authorizeview-component) (Example: `<AuthorizeView Roles="admin">`)
* [`[Authorize]` attribute directive](xref:blazor/security/index#authorize-attribute) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizeAttribute>) (Example: `@attribute [Authorize(Roles = "admin")]`)
* [Procedural logic](xref:blazor/security/index#procedural-logic) (Example: `if (user.IsInRole("admin")) { ... }`)

  Multiple role tests are supported:

  ```csharp
  if (user.IsInRole("admin") && user.IsInRole("developer"))
  {
      ...
  }
  ```

`User.Identity.Name` is populated in the **`Client`** app with the user's user name, which is usually their sign-in email address.

## Host in Azure App Service with a custom domain and certificate

The following guidance explains:

* How to deploy a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app with Identity Server to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) with a custom domain.
* How to create and use a TLS certificate for HTTPS protocol communication with browsers. Although the guidance focuses on using the certificate with a custom domain, the guidance is equally applicable to using a default Azure Apps domain, for example `contoso.azurewebsites.net`.

For this hosting scenario, do **not** use the same certificate for [Identity Server's token signing key](https://docs.identityserver.io/en/latest/topics/crypto.html#token-signing-and-validation) and the site's HTTPS secure communication with browsers:

* Using different certificates for these two requirements is a good security practice because it isolates private keys for each purpose.
* TLS certificates for communication with browsers is managed independently without affecting Identity Server's token signing.
* When [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) supplies a certificate to an App Service app for custom domain binding, Identity Server can't obtain the same certificate from Azure Key Vault for token signing. Although configuring Identity Server to use the same TLS certificate from a physical path is possible, placing security certificates into source control is a **poor practice and should be avoided in most scenarios**.

In the following guidance, a self-signed certificate is created in Azure Key Vault solely for Identity Server token signing. The Identity Server configuration uses the key vault certificate via the app's `CurrentUser` > `My` certificate store. Other certificates used for HTTPS traffic with custom domains are created and configured separately from the Identity Server signing certificate.

To configure an app, Azure App Service, and Azure Key Vault to host with a custom domain and HTTPS:

1. Create an [App Service plan](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans) with an plan level of `Basic B1` or higher. App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.
1. Create a PFX certificate for the site's secure browser communication (HTTPS protocol) with a common name of the site's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your organization controls (for example, `www.contoso.com`). Create the certificate with:
   * Key uses
     * Digital signature validation (`digitalSignature`)
     * Key encipherment (`keyEncipherment`)
   * Enhanced/extended key uses
     * Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)
     * Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)

   To create the certificate, use one of the following approaches or any other suitable tool or online service:

   * [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal#add-a-certificate-to-key-vault)
   * [MakeCert on Windows](/windows/desktop/seccrypto/makecert)
   * [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org)

   Make note of the password, which is used later to import the certificate into Azure Key Vault.

   For more information on Azure Key Vault certificates, see [Azure Key Vault: Certificates](/azure/key-vault/certificates/).
1. Create a new Azure Key Vault or use an existing key vault in your Azure subscription.
1. In the key vault's **Certificates** area, import the PFX site certificate. Record the certificate's thumbprint, which is used in the app's configuration later.
1. In Azure Key Vault, generate a new self-signed certificate for Identity Server token signing. Give the certificate a **Certificate Name** and **Subject**. The **Subject** is specified as `CN={COMMON NAME}`, where the `{COMMON NAME}` placeholder is the certificate's common name. The common name can be any alphanumeric string. For example, `CN=IdentityServerSigning` is a valid certificate **Subject**. In **Issuance Policy** > **Advanced Policy Configuration**, use the default settings. Record the certificate's thumbprint, which is used in the app's configuration later.
1. Navigate to Azure App Service in the Azure portal and create a new App Service with the following configuration:
   * **Publish** set to `Code`.
   * **Runtime stack** set to the app's runtime.
   * For **Sku and size**, confirm that the App Service tier is `Basic B1` or higher.  App Service requires a `Basic B1` or higher service tier to use custom domains.
1. After Azure creates the App Service, open the app's **Configuration** and add a new application setting specifying the certificate thumbprints recorded earlier. The app setting key is `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES`. Separate the certificate thumbprints in the app setting value with a comma, as the following example shows:
   * Key: `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES`
   * Value: `57443A552A46DB...D55E28D412B943565,29F43A772CB6AF...1D04F0C67F85FB0B1`

   In the Azure portal, saving app settings is a two-step process: Save the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` key-value setting, then select the **Save** button at the top of the blade.
1. Select the app's **TLS/SSL settings**. Select **Private Key Certificates (.pfx)**. Use the **Import Key Vault Certificate** process. **Use the process _twice_ to import the site's certificate for HTTPS communication and the site's self-signed Identity Server token signing certificate.**
1. Navigate to the **Custom domains** blade. At your domain registrar's website, use the **IP address** and **Custom Domain Verification ID** to configure the domain. A typical domain configuration includes:
   * An **A Record** with a **Host** of `@` and a value of the IP address from the Azure portal.
   * A **TXT Record** with a **Host** of `asuid` and the value of the verification ID generated by Azure and provided by the Azure portal.

   Make sure that you save the changes at your domain registrar's website correctly. Some registrar websites require a two-step process to save domain records: One or more records are saved individually followed by updating the domain's registration with a separate button.
1. Return to the **Custom domains** blade in the Azure portal. Select **Add custom domain**. Select the **A Record** option. Provide the domain and select **Validate**. If the domain records are correct and propagated across the Internet, the portal allows you to select the **Add custom domain** button.

   It can take a few days for domain registration changes to propagate across Internet domain name servers (DNS) after they're processed by your domain registrar. If domain records aren't updated within three business days, confirm the records are correctly set with the domain registrar and contact their customer support.
1. In the **Custom domains** blade, the **SSL STATE** for the domain is marked `Not Secure`. Select the **Add binding** link. Select the site HTTPS certificate from the key vault for the custom domain binding.
1. In Visual Studio, open the *Server* project's app settings file (`appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Production.json`). In the Identity Server configuration, add the following `Key` section. Specify the self-signed certificate **Subject** for the `Name` key. In the following example, the certificate's common name assigned in the key vault is `IdentityServerSigning`, which yields a **Subject** of `CN=IdentityServerSigning`:

   ```json
   "IdentityServer": {

     ...

     "Key": {
       "Type": "Store",
       "StoreName": "My",
       "StoreLocation": "CurrentUser",
       "Name": "CN=IdentityServerSigning"
     }
   },
   ```

1. In Visual Studio, create an Azure App Service [publish profile](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles#publish-profiles) for the *Server* project. From the menu bar, select: **Build** > **Publish** > **New** > **Azure** > **Azure App Service** (Windows or Linux). When Visual Studio is connected to an Azure subscription, you can set the **View** of Azure resources by **Resource type**. Navigate within the **Web App** list to find the App Service for the app and select it. Select **Finish**.
1. When Visual Studio returns to the **Publish** window, the key vault and SQL Server database service dependencies are automatically detected.

   No configuration changes to the default settings are required for the key vault service.

   For testing purposes, an app's local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, which is configured by default by the Blazor template, can be deployed with the app without additional configuration. Configuring a different database for Identity Server in production is beyond the scope of this article. For more information, see the database resources in the following documentation sets:
   * [App Service](/azure/app-service/)
   * [Identity Server](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

1. Select the **Edit** link under the deployment profile name at the top of the window. Change the destination URL to the site's custom domain URL (for example, `https://www.contoso.com`). Save the settings.
1. Publish the app. Visual Studio opens a browser window and requests the site at its custom domain.

The Azure documentation contains additional detail on using Azure services and custom domains with TLS binding in App Service, including information on using CNAME records instead of A records. For more information, see the following resources:

* [App Service documentation](/azure/app-service/)
* [Tutorial: Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain)
* [Secure a custom DNS name with a TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings)
* [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/)

We recommend using a new in-private or incognito browser window for each app test run after a change to the app, app configuration, or Azure services in the Azure portal. Lingering cookies from a previous test run can result in failed authentication or authorization when testing the site even when the site's configuration is correct. For more information on how to configure Visual Studio to open a new in-private or incognito browser window for each test run, see the [Cookies and site data](#cookies-and-site-data) section.

When App Service configuration is changed in the Azure portal, the updates generally take effect quickly but aren't instant. Sometimes, you must wait a short period for an App Service to restart in order for a configuration change to take effect.

If troubleshooting an Identity Server key-signing certificate loading problem, execute the following command in an Azure portal [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-the-kudu-service) PowerShell command shell. The command provides a list of certificates that the app can access from the `CurrentUser` > `My` certificate store. The output includes certificate subjects and thumbprints useful when debugging an app:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -path Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Recurse | Format-List DnsNameList, Subject, Thumbprint, EnhancedKeyUsageList
```
