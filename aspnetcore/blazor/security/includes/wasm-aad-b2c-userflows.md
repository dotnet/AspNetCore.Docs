## Custom user flows

The Microsoft Authentication Library (<xref:Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal>, [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal/)) doesn't support [AAD B2C user flows](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview) by default. Create custom user flows in developer code.

For more information on how to build a challenge for a custom user flow, see [User flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview).
