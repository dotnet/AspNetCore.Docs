The `App` component (`App.razor`) is similar to the `App` component found in Blazor Server apps:

* The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization.CascadingAuthenticationState> component manages exposing the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization.AuthenticationState> to the rest of the app.
* The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization.AuthorizeRouteView> component makes sure that the current user is authorized to access a given page or otherwise renders the `RedirectToLogin` component.
* The `RedirectToLogin` component manages redirecting unauthorized users to the login page.

Due to changes in the framework across releases of ASP.NET Core, Razor markup for the `App` component (`App.razor`) isn't shown in this section. To inspect the markup of the component for a given release, use ***either*** of the following approaches:

* Create an app provisioned for authentication from the default Blazor WebAssembly project template for the version of ASP.NET Core that you intend to use. Inspect the `App` component (`App.razor`) in the generated app.
* Inspect the `App` component (`App.razor`) in [reference source](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/ProjectTemplates/Web.ProjectTemplates/content/ComponentsWebAssembly-CSharp/Client/App.razor).
