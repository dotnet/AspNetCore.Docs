The Index page (`wwwroot/index.html`) page includes a script that defines the `AuthenticationService` in JavaScript. `AuthenticationService` handles the low-level details of the OIDC protocol. The app internally calls methods defined in the script to perform the authentication operations.

```html
<script src="_content/Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal/
    AuthenticationService.js"></script>
```
