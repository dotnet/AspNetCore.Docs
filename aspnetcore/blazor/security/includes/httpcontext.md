**Don't use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextAccessor>/<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext> directly or indirectly in the Razor components of Blazor Server apps.** Blazor apps run outside of the ASP.NET Core pipeline context. The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext> isn't guaranteed to be available within the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextAccessor>, and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext> isn't guaranteed to hold the context that started the Blazor app.

The recommended approach for passing request state to the Blazor app is through root component parameters during the app's initial rendering. Alternatively, the app can copy the data into a scoped service in the root component's initialization lifecycle event for use across the app. For more information, see <xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-blazor-server-app>.

A critical aspect of Blazor Server security is that the user attached to a given circuit might become updated at some point after the Blazor circuit is established but the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextAccessor> ***isn't updated***. For more information on addressing this situation with custom services, see <xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#circuit-handler-to-capture-users-for-custom-services>.
