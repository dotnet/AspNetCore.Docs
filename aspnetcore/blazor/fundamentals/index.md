# ASP.NET Core Blazor fundamentals

*Fundamentals* articles provide guidance on foundational Blazor concepts. Some of the concepts are connected to a basic understanding of *Razor components*, which are described further in the next section of this article and covered in detail in the *Components* articles.

## Razor components

Blazor apps are based on *Razor components*, often referred to as just *components*. Components are covered in detail in the *Components* articles, but it's important to learn component basics and note conventions used in the articles before reading *Fundamentals* articles, which use components to demonstrate concepts.

A *component* is an element of UI, such as a page, dialog, or data entry form. Components are .NET C# classes built into [.NET assemblies](/dotnet/standard/assembly/).

*Razor* refers to how components are usually written in the form of a [Razor](xref:mvc/views/razor) markup page for client-side UI logic and composition. Razor is a syntax for combining HTML markup with C# code designed for developer productivity. Razor files use the `.razor` file extension.

Although some Blazor developers and online resources use the term "Blazor components," the documentation avoids that term and universally uses "Razor components" or "components."

Blazor documentation adopts several conventions for showing and discussing components:

* Project code, file paths and names, project template names, and other specialized terms are in United States English and usually code-fenced.
* Components are usually referred to by their C# class name (Pascal case) followed by the word "component." For example, a typical file upload component is referred to as the "`FileUpload` component."
* Usually, a component's C# class name is the same as its file name. Component paths within an app are usually indicated. For example, `Pages/FileUpload.razor`.
* Routable components usually set their relative URLs to the component's class name in kebab-case. For example, a `FileUpload` component includes routing configuration to reach the rendered component at the relative URL `/file-upload`. Routing and navigation is covered in <xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing>.
* When multiple versions of a component are used, they're numbered sequentially. For example, the `FileUpload3` component has a file name and location of `Pages/FileUpload3.razor` and is reached at `/file-upload-3`.
* Access modifiers are used in article examples. For example, fields are `private` by default but are explicitly present in component code. For example, `private` is stated for declaring a field named `maxAllowedFiles` as `private int maxAllowedFiles = 3;`.
* Generally, examples adhere to ASP.NET Core/C# coding conventions and engineering guidelines. For more information see the following resources:
  * [Engineering guidelines (`dotnet/aspnetcore` GitHub repository)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines)
  * [C# Coding Conventions (C# guide)](/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)

The following is an example counter component and part of an app created from a Blazor project template. Detailed components coverage is found in the *Components* articles later in the documentation. The following example demonstrates component concepts seen in the *Fundamentals* articles before reaching the *Components* articles later in the documentation.

`Pages/Counter.razor`:

```razor
@page "/counter"

<PageTitle>Counter</PageTitle>

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p role="status">Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

The preceding `Counter` component:

* Sets its route with the `@page` directive in the first line.
* Sets its page title and heading.
* Renders the current count with `@currentCount`. `currentCount` is an integer variable defined in the C# code of the `@code` block.
* Displays a button to trigger the `IncrementCount` method, which is also found in the `@code` block and increases the value of the `currentCount` variable.

## Sample apps

Sample apps are available to assist with implementing guidance or for reference articles or tutorials.

### Blazor Server with EF Core

Blazor Server EF Core sample app (ASP.NET Core 6.0):

* [Browse on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/blazor/samples/6.0/BlazorServerEFCoreSample)
* [Download](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/blazor/samples/6.0/BlazorServerDbContextExample.zip)

For more information, see <xref:blazor/blazor-server-ef-core>.

### Blazor with SignalR

Blazor SignalR sample app (ASP.NET Core 6.0):

[Browse on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/tutorials/signalr-blazor/samples/6.0)

For more information, see <xref:tutorials/signalr-blazor>.

### Snippet sample apps for article code examples

Snippet sample apps for Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly provide the code examples that appear in Blazor articles. Snippet sample apps compile and run. However, several of the examples aren't fully working in their current form because either of the following are true for the article's examples:

* The example requires extra Razor, C#, or other code to run correctly that the article's example doesn't require in order to explain Blazor concepts.
* The example requires additional packages to use additional API, sometimes third-party packages, an account (token or key) for an external service, or another app (for example, a separate running web API app to interact with over a network). Usually, the article associated with the example provides additional guidance on how to make the example work in a live test app.

> [!WARNING]
> Always follow an article's security guidance when implementing sample code.

The `dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs` GitHub repository location and a direct download link for snippet sample apps appear in the following table. Select the GitHub link to browse the sample app online at GitHub. Use the download link to obtain a ZIP archive of the sample app, which permits use of the sample app locally without requiring a [download of the entire `dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs` repository](xref:index#how-to-download-a-sample).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The primary purpose of the snippet sample apps is to supply code examples to documentation, not to illustrate Blazor best practices. The best use of the sample app code is to facilitate copying examples into local test apps for experimentation and further customization for use in production apps. Namespaces, names, and locations of app resources are contrived in order to maintain the code efficiently for articles and make sure that the code compiles:
>
> * Folder names and folder locations throughout the snippet sample apps roughly match the type of example and article subject. They aren't meant to represent the folder names and layout of a real production app.
> * C# files (`.cs`) often appear in the root of the app's folder, which isn't normal for typical production apps.
> * Some components create mock C# objects instead of using formal, correct code to create the objects. For example, a component that requires a list of `TodoItem` items might include an `@code` block as its first line (`@code{ private List<TodoItem> todos = new(); }`) to create a variable for use in the example ***that the article doesn't show to readers***. To implement these unfinished examples in a production app for users, finish the code and supply an `@code` block with formal, correct code to create the required objects. The purpose of using these mocked C# objects in the snippet sample apps is to make sure that the code compiles correctly for the documentation.
> * Some components only show a portion of their Razor markup in an article. This is accomplished by surrounding the code for display with snippet HTML comments (for example, `<!-- <snippet> -->...<!-- </snippet> -->`). These comments can be removed or ignored, as they have no purpose in an ordinary Blazor app outside of the documentation.
