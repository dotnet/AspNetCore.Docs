# ASP.NET Core Blazor environments

This article explains [ASP.NET Core environments](xref:fundamentals/environments) in Blazor, including how to set the environment.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0 < aspnetcore-7.0"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic applies to Blazor WebAssembly. For general guidance on ASP.NET Core app configuration, which describes the approaches to use for Blazor Server apps, see <xref:fundamentals/environments>.

When running an app locally, the environment defaults to `Development`. When the app is published, the environment defaults to `Production`.

The environment is set using any of the following approaches:

* [Blazor start configuration](#set-the-environment-via-startup-configuration)
* [`Blazor-Environment` header](#set-the-environment-via-header)
* [Azure App Service](#set-the-environment-for-azure-app-service)

The client-side Blazor app (**`Client`**) of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly [solution](xref:blazor/tooling#visual-studio-solution-file-sln) determines the environment from the **`Server`** app of the solution via a middleware that communicates the environment to the browser. The **`Server`** app adds a header named `Blazor-Environment` with the environment as the value of the header. The **`Client`** app reads the header. The **`Server`** app of the solution is an ASP.NET Core app, so more information on how to configure the environment is found in <xref:fundamentals/environments>.

For a standalone Blazor WebAssembly app running locally, the development server adds the `Blazor-Environment` header to specify the `Development` environment.

## Set the environment via startup configuration

The following example starts Blazor in the `Staging` environment if the hostname includes `localhost`. Otherwise, the environment is set to `Production`.

Inside the closing `</body>` tag of `wwwroot/index.html`:

```cshtml
<script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js" autostart="false"></script>
<script>
  if (window.location.hostname.includes("localhost")) {
    Blazor.start({
      environment: "Staging"
    });
  } else {
    Blazor.start({
      environment: "Production"
    });
  }
</script>
```

Using the `environment` property overrides the environment set by the [`Blazor-Environment` header](#set-the-environment-via-header).

For more information on Blazor startup, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/startup>.

## Set the environment via header

To specify the environment for other hosting environments, add the `Blazor-Environment` header.

In the following example for IIS, the custom header (`Blazor-Environment`) is added to the published `web.config` file. The `web.config` file is located in the `bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish` folder, where the placeholder `{TARGET FRAMEWORK}` is the target framework:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>

    ...

    <httpProtocol>
      <customHeaders>
        <add name="Blazor-Environment" value="Staging" />
      </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use a custom `web.config` file for IIS that isn't overwritten when the app is published to the `publish` folder, see <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly#use-a-custom-webconfig>.

## Set the environment for Azure App Service

***The guidance in this section requires the use of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app.***

> [!NOTE]
> For **standalone Blazor Webassembly apps**, set the environment manually via [start configuration](#set-the-environment-via-startup-configuration) or the [`Blazor-Environment` header](#set-the-environment-via-header).

Use the following guidance for hosted Blazor WebAssembly solutions hosted by Azure App Service:

1. Confirm that the casing of environment segments in app settings filenames matches their environment name casing ***exactly***. For example, the matching app settings filename for the `Staging` environment is `appsettings.Staging.json`. If the filename is `appsettings.staging.json` (lowercase "`s`"), the file isn't located, and the settings in the file aren't used in the `Staging` environment.

1. In the Azure portal for the environment's deployment slot, set the environment with the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` app setting. For an app named `BlazorAzureAppSample`, the staging App Service Slot is named `BlazorAzureAppSample/Staging`. For the `Staging` slot's configuration, create an app setting for `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` with a value of `Staging`. **Deployment slot setting** is enabled for the setting.

1. For Visual Studio deployment, confirm that the app is deployed to the correct deployment slot. For an app named `BlazorAzureAppSample`, the app is deployed to the `Staging` deployment slot.

When requested in a browser, the `BlazorAzureAppSample/Staging` app loads in the `Staging` environment at `https://blazorazureappsample-staging.azurewebsites.net`.

When the app is loaded in the browser, the response header collection for `blazor.boot.json` indicates that the `Blazor-Environment` header value is `Staging`.

App settings from the `appsettings.{ENVIRONMENT}.json` file are loaded by the app, where the `{ENVIRONMENT}` placeholder is the app's environment. In the preceding example, settings from the `appsettings.Staging.json` file are loaded.

## Read the environment

Obtain the app's environment in a component by injecting <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment> and reading the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.Environment> property.

`Pages/ReadEnvironment.razor`:

:::code language="razor" source="~/../blazor-samples/6.0/BlazorSample_WebAssembly/Pages/environments/ReadEnvironment.razor" highlight="3,7":::

During startup, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostBuilder> exposes the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment> through the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostBuilder.HostEnvironment> property, which enables environment-specific logic in host builder code.

In `Program.cs`:

```csharp
if (builder.HostEnvironment.Environment == "Custom")
{
    ...
};
```

The following convenience extension methods provided through <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostEnvironmentExtensions> permit checking the current environment for `Development`, `Production`, `Staging`, and custom environment names:

* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostEnvironmentExtensions.IsDevelopment%2A>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostEnvironmentExtensions.IsProduction%2A>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostEnvironmentExtensions.IsStaging%2A>
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostEnvironmentExtensions.IsEnvironment%2A>

In `Program.cs`:

```csharp
if (builder.HostEnvironment.IsStaging())
{
    ...
};

if (builder.HostEnvironment.IsEnvironment("Custom"))
{
    ...
};
```

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress?displayProperty=nameWithType> property can be used during startup when the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.NavigationManager> service isn't available.
