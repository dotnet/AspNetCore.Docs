# Tooling for ASP.NET Core Blazor

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This article describes tools for building Blazor apps on various platforms. Select your platform at the top of this article.

:::zone pivot="windows"

To create a Blazor app on Windows, use the following guidance:

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

* Install the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload.

* Create a new project using one of the available Blazor templates:

  * **Blazor Web App**: Creates a Blazor web app that supports interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR). The Blazor Web App template is recommended for getting started with Blazor to learn about server-side and client-side Blazor features.
  * **Blazor WebAssembly Standalone App**: Creates a standalone client web app that can be deployed as a static site.

Select **Next**.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-7.0 < aspnetcore-8.0"

* Install the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload.

* Create a new project:
  * For a Blazor Server experience, choose the **Blazor Server App** template, which includes demonstration code and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), or the **Blazor Server App Empty** template without demonstration code and Bootstrap. Select **Next**.
  * For a standalone Blazor WebAssembly experience, choose the **Blazor WebAssembly App** template, which includes demonstration code and Bootstrap, or the **Blazor WebAssembly App Empty** template without demonstration code and Bootstrap. Select **Next**.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-7.0"

* Install the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload.

* Create a new project:
  * For a Blazor Server experience, choose the **Blazor Server App** template. Select **Next**.
  * For a Blazor WebAssembly experience, choose the **Blazor WebAssembly App** template. Select **Next**.

:::moniker-end

* Provide a **Project name** and confirm that the **Location** is correct.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

> [!NOTE]
> Rendering terms and concepts used in the following guidance are introduced in the following sections of the *Fundamentals* overview article:
>
> * [Client and server rendering concepts](xref:blazor/fundamentals/index#client-and-server-rendering-concepts)
> * [Static and interactive rendering concepts](xref:blazor/fundamentals/index#static-and-interactive-rendering-concepts)
> * [Render modes](xref:blazor/fundamentals/index#render-modes)
>
> Detailed guidance on render modes is provided by the <xref:blazor/components/render-modes> article.

* For a Blazor Web App in the **Additional information** dialog:

  * **Interactive render mode** dropdown list
  
    * Interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR) is enabled by default with the **Server** option.
    * To only enable interactivity with client-side rendering (CSR), select the **WebAssembly** option.
    * To enable both interactive rendering modes and the ability to automatically switch between them at runtime, select the **Auto (Server and WebAssembly)** (automatic) render mode option.
    * If interactivity is set to `None`, the generated app has no interactivity. The app is only configured for static server-side rendering.

    The Interactive Auto render mode initially uses interactive SSR while the .NET app bundle and runtime are download to the browser. After the .NET WebAssembly runtime is activated, the render mode switches to Interactive WebAssembly rendering.

    By default, the Blazor Web App template enables both static and interactive SSR using a single project. If you also enable CSR, the project includes an additional client project (`.Client`) for your WebAssembly-based components. The built output from the client project is downloaded to the browser and executed on the client. Any components using the WebAssembly or automatic render modes must be built from the client project.

    For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/render-modes>.

  * **Interactivity location** dropdown list

    * **Per page/component**: The default sets up interactivity per page or per component.
    * **Global**: Selecting this option sets up interactivity globally for the entire app.

    Interactivity location can only be set if **Interactive render mode** isn't `None` and authentication isn't enabled.

  * To include sample pages and a layout based on Bootstrap styling, select the **Include sample pages** checkbox. Disable this option for project without sample pages and Bootstrap styling.

  For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/render-modes>.

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-8.0"

* For a *hosted* Blazor WebAssembly app, select the **ASP.NET Core Hosted** checkbox in the **Additional information** dialog.

:::moniker-end

* Select **Create**.

* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (macOS) to run the app.

:::zone pivot="linux-macos"

To create a Blazor app on Linux or macOS, use the following guidance:

Use the [.NET command-line interface (CLI)](/dotnet/core/tools/) to execute commands in a command shell.

Install the latest version of the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). If you previously installed the SDK, you can determine your installed version by executing the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet --version
```

Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for your platform.

Install the [C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit). For more information, see <xref:blazor/debug#visual-studio-code-prerequisites>.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

Create a new project:

* For a Blazor Web App experience with default interactive server-side rendering, execute the following command in a command shell that uses the `blazor` project template:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp
  ```

  To only enable client-side rendering, use the `-int|--interactivity` option set to `WebAssembly`:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp -int WebAssembly
  ```

  To enable interactive server-side rendering followed by client-side rendering, use the `-int|--interactivity` option set to `Auto`:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp -int Auto
  ```

  If interactivity is disabled by setting the `-int|--interactivity` option to `None`, the generated app has no interactivity. The app is only configured for static server-side rendering:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp -int None
  ```

  The Interactive Auto render mode initially uses the interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR) while the .NET app bundle and runtime are download to the browser. After the .NET WebAssembly runtime is activated, the render mode switches to the Interactive WebAssembly render mode.

  By default, the Blazor Web App template enables both static and interactive server-side rendering using a single project. If you also enable the Interactive WebAssembly render mode, the project includes an additional client project (`.Client`) for your WebAssembly-based components. The built output from the client project is downloaded to the browser and executed on the client. Any components using the Interactive WebAssembly or Interactive Auto render modes must be built from the client project.

  For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/render-modes>.

  Apps default the interactivity location on a per-component/page basis. To establish interactivity across the entire app, use the `-ai|--all-interactive` option:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp -ai
  ```

  Selecting this option sets interactivity for entire app in the `App` component by specifying a render mode for the top-level `HeadOutlet` and `Routes` components. Setting the interactivity on these components propagates the interactivity to all of the child components in the app.

  Interactivity location can only be set if the interactive render mode (`-int|--interactivity`) isn't `None` and authentication isn't enabled.

  To create an app without sample pages and styling, use the `-e|--empty` option:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorApp -e
  ```

* For a standalone Blazor WebAssembly experience, execute the following command in a command shell that uses the `blazorwasm` template:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazorApp
  ```

  To create an standalone Blazor WebAssembly app without sample pages and styling, use the `-e|--empty` option:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazorApp -e
  ```

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-7.0 < aspnetcore-8.0"

Create a new project:

* For a Blazor Server experience with demonstration code and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), execute the following command:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorApp
  ```

* Alternatively, create a Blazor Server app without demonstration code and Bootstrap using the `blazorserver-empty` project template:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorserver-empty -o BlazorApp
  ```

* For a standalone Blazor WebAssembly experience with demonstration code and Bootstrap, execute the following command:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazorApp
  ```

* Alternatively, create a standalone Blazor WebAssembly app without demonstration code and Bootstrap using the `blazorwasm-empty` project template:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorwasm-empty -o BlazorApp
  ```

* For a hosted Blazor WebAssembly experience with demonstration code and Bootstrap, add the hosted option (`-ho`/`--hosted`) to the command:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazorApp -ho
  ```

* Alternatively, create a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app without demonstration code and Bootstrap using the `blazorwasm-empty` template with the hosted option:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorwasm-empty -o BlazorApp -ho
  ```

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-7.0"

Create a new project:

* For a Blazor WebAssembly experience, execute the following command:

  ```

* For a Blazor Server experience, execute the following command:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorApp
  ```

:::moniker-end

Open the `BlazorApp` folder in Visual Studio Code.

When Visual Studio Code requests that you add assets to build and debug the project, select **Yes**.

If Visual Studio Code doesn't automatically offer to add build and debug assets (the `.vscode` folder with `launch.json` and `tasks.json` files), select **View** > **Command Palette** and type "`.NET`" into the search box. From the list of commands, select the "`.NET: Generate Assets for Build and Debug`" command.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on Visual Studio Code configuration and use, see the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

The project's `Properties/launchSettings.json` file includes the `inspectUri` property for the debugging proxy for any profiles in the `profiles` section of the file:

```json
"inspectUri": "{wsProtocol}://{url.hostname}:{url.port}/_framework/debug/ws-proxy?browser={browserInspectUri}",
```

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-8.0"

**Hosted Blazor WebAssembly launch and task configuration**

For hosted Blazor WebAssembly [solutions](#visual-studio-solution-file-sln), add (or move) the `.vscode` folder with `launch.json` and `tasks.json` files to the solution's parent folder, which is the folder that contains the typical project folders: :::no-loc text="Client":::, :::no-loc text="Server":::, and `Shared`. Update or confirm that the configuration in the `launch.json` and `tasks.json` files execute a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app from the **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When executing a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app, run the app from the solution's **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project.
>
> When the app is launched, only the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file in the :::no-loc text="Server"::: project is used.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0 < aspnetcore-8.0"

Examine the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file and determine the URL of the app from the `applicationUrl` property. Depending on the framework version, the URL protocol is either secure (HTTPS) `https://localhost:{PORT}` or insecure (HTTP) `http://localhost:{PORT}`, where the `{PORT}` placeholder is an assigned port. Note the URL for use in the `launch.json` file.

In the launch configuration of the `.vscode/launch.json` file:

* Set the current working directory (`cwd`) to the **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project folder.
* Indicate the app's URL with the `url` property. Use the value recorded earlier from the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file.

```json
"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/{SERVER APP FOLDER}",
"url": "{URL}"
```

In the preceding configuration:

* The `{SERVER APP FOLDER}` placeholder is the **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project's folder, typically :::no-loc text="Server":::.
* The `{URL}` placeholder is the app's URL, which is specified in the app's `Properties/launchSettings.json` file in the `applicationUrl` property.

If Google Chrome is preferred over Microsoft Edge, update or add an additional property of `"browser": "chrome"` to the configuration.

The following example `.vscode/launch.json` file:

* Sets the current working directory to the :::no-loc text="Server"::: folder.
* Sets the URL for the app to `http://localhost:7268`.
* Changes the default browser from Microsoft Edge to Google Chrome.

```json
"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/Server",
"url": "http://localhost:7268",
"browser": "chrome"
```

The complete `.vscode/launch.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "blazorwasm",
      "name": "Launch and Debug Blazor WebAssembly Application",
      "request": "launch",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/Server",
      "url": "http://localhost:7268",
      "browser": "chrome"
    }
  ]
}
```

In `.vscode/tasks.json`, add a `build` argument that specifies the path to the **:::no-loc text="Server":::** app's project file:

```json
"${workspaceFolder}/{SERVER APP FOLDER}/{PROJECT NAME}.csproj",
```

In the preceding argument:

* The `{SERVER APP FOLDER}` placeholder is the **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project's folder, typically :::no-loc text="Server":::.
* The `{PROJECT NAME}` placeholder is the app's name, typically based on the solution's name followed by `.Server` in an app generated from the Blazor WebAssembly project template.

An example `.vscode/tasks.json` file with a **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project named `BlazorHosted` in the :::no-loc text="Server"::: folder of the solution:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "build",
      "command": "dotnet",
      "type": "process",
        "args": [
          "build",
          "${workspaceFolder}/Server/BlazorHosted.Server.csproj",
          "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
          "/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary",
        ],
        "group": "build",
        "presentation": {
          "reveal": "silent"
        },
        "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
    }
  ]
}
```

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (macOS) to run the app.

> [!NOTE]
> Only [browser debugging](xref:blazor/debug#debug-in-the-browser) is supported at this time.
>
> You can't automatically rebuild the backend **:::no-loc text="Server":::** app of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution during debugging, for example by running the app with [`dotnet watch run`](xref:tutorials/dotnet-watch).

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-6.0"

**`.vscode/launch.json`** (`launch` configuration):

```json
...
"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/{SERVER APP FOLDER}",
...
```

In the preceding configuration for the current working directory (`cwd`), the `{SERVER APP FOLDER}` placeholder is the **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project's folder, typically ":::no-loc text="Server":::".

If Microsoft Edge is used and Google Chrome isn't installed on the system, add an additional property of `"browser": "edge"` to the configuration.

Example for a project folder of :::no-loc text="Server"::: and that spawns Microsoft Edge as the browser for debug runs instead of the default browser Google Chrome:

```json
...
"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/Server",
"browser": "edge"
...
```

**`.vscode/tasks.json`** ([`dotnet` command](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) arguments):

```json
...
"${workspaceFolder}/{SERVER APP FOLDER}/{PROJECT NAME}.csproj",
...
```

In the preceding argument:

* The `{SERVER APP FOLDER}` placeholder is the **:::no-loc text="Server":::** project's folder, typically ":::no-loc text="Server":::".
* The `{PROJECT NAME}` placeholder is the app's name, typically based on the solution's name followed by "`.Server`" in an app generated from the [Blazor project template](xref:blazor/project-structure).

The following example from the [tutorial for using SignalR with a Blazor WebAssembly app](xref:blazor/tutorials/signalr-blazor) uses a project folder name of :::no-loc text="Server"::: and a project name of `BlazorWebAssemblySignalRApp.Server`:

```json
...
"args": [
  "build",
    "${workspaceFolder}/Server/BlazorWebAssemblySignalRApp.Server.csproj",
    ...
],
...
```

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (macOS) to run the app.

## Visual Studio solution file (`.sln`)

A *solution* is a container to organize one or more related code projects. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) uses a solution file (`.sln`) to store settings for a solution. Solution files use a unique format and aren't intended to be edited directly.

Tooling outside of Visual Studio can interact with solution files:

* The [.NET CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/) can create solution files and list/modify the projects in solution files via the [`dotnet sln` command](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-sln). Other .NET CLI commands use the path of the solution file for various publishing, testing, and packaging commands.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) can execute the `dotnet sln` command and other .NET CLI commands through its integrated terminal but doesn't use the settings in a solution file directly.

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-8.0"

Throughout the Blazor documentation, *solution* is used to describe apps created from the Blazor WebAssembly project template with the **ASP.NET Core Hosted** option enabled or from a Blazor Hybrid project template. Apps produced from these project templates include a solution file (`.sln`) by default. For hosted Blazor WebAssembly apps where the developer isn't using Visual Studio, the solution file can be ignored or deleted if it isn't used with .NET CLI commands.

:::moniker-end

For more information, see the following resources in the Visual Studio documentation:

* [Introduction to projects and solutions](/visualstudio/get-started/tutorial-projects-solutions)
* [What are solutions and projects in Visual Studio?](/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio)

## Use Visual Studio Code for cross-platform Blazor development

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open source, cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can be used to develop Blazor apps. Use the [.NET CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/) to create a new Blazor app for development with Visual Studio Code. For more information, see the [Linux/macOS version of this article](?pivots=linux-macos).

For more information on Visual Studio Code configuration and use, see the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

## Blazor template options

The Blazor framework provides templates for creating new apps. The templates are used to create new Blazor projects and solutions regardless of the tooling that you select for Blazor development (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the [.NET command-line interface (CLI)](/dotnet/core/tools/)):

## .NET WebAssembly build tools

The .NET WebAssembly build tools are based on [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/), a compiler toolchain for the web platform. To install the build tools, use ***either*** of the following approaches:

* For the **ASP.NET and web development** workload in the Visual Studio installer, select the **.NET WebAssembly build tools** option from the list of optional components.
* Execute `dotnet workload install wasm-tools` in an administrative command shell.

> [!NOTE]
> .NET WebAssembly build tools for .NET 6 projects
>
> The `wasm-tools` workload installs the build tools for the latest release. However, the current version of the build tools are incompatible with existing projects built with .NET 6. Projects using the build tools that must support both .NET 6 and a later release must use multi-targeting.
>
> Use the `wasm-tools-net6` workload for .NET 6 projects when developing apps with the .NET 7 SDK. To install the `wasm-tools-net6` workload, execute the following command from an administrative command shell:
>
> ```dotnetcli
> dotnet workload install wasm-tools-net6
> ```

### Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation

To enable [ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation](xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation), set `<RunAOTCompilation>` to `true` in the app's project file (`.csproj`):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <RunAOTCompilation>true</RunAOTCompilation>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

[WebAssembly Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/blob/master/proposals/simd/SIMD.md) can improve the throughput of vectorized computations by performing an operation on multiple pieces of data in parallel using a single instruction. SIMD is enabled by default.

To disable SIMD, for example when targeting old browsers or browsers on mobile devices that don't support SIMD, set the `<WasmEnableSIMD>` property to `false` in the app's project file (`.csproj`):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <WasmEnableSIMD>false</WasmEnableSIMD>
</PropertyGroup>
```

For more information, see [Configuring and hosting .NET WebAssembly applications: SIMD - Single instruction, multiple data](https://aka.ms/dotnet-wasm-features#simd---single-instruction-multiple-data) and note that the guidance isn't versioned and applies to the latest public release.
