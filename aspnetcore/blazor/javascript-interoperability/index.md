# ASP.NET Core Blazor JavaScript interoperability (JS interop)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This article explains general concepts on how to interact with JavaScript in Blazor apps.

A Blazor app can invoke JavaScript (JS) functions from .NET methods and .NET methods from JS functions. These scenarios are called *JavaScript interoperability* (*JS interop*).

Further JS interop guidance is provided in the following articles:

* <xref:blazor/js-interop/call-javascript-from-dotnet>
* <xref:blazor/js-interop/call-dotnet-from-javascript>

## JavaScript interop abstractions and features package

The [`@microsoft/dotnet-js-interop` package (`npmjs.com`)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/dotnet-js-interop) provides abstractions and features for interop between .NET and JavaScript (JS) code. Reference source is available in the [`dotnet/aspnetcore` GitHub repository (`/src/JSInterop` folder)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/JSInterop). For more information, see the GitHub repository's `README.md` file.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/aspnetcore-repo-ref-source-links.md)]

## Interaction with the DOM

Only mutate the DOM with JavaScript (JS) when the object doesn't interact with Blazor. Blazor maintains representations of the DOM and interacts directly with DOM objects. If an element rendered by Blazor is modified externally using JS directly or via JS Interop, the DOM may no longer match Blazor's internal representation, which can result in undefined behavior. Undefined behavior may merely interfere with the presentation of elements or their functions but may also introduce security risks to the app or server.

This guidance not only applies to your own JS interop code but also to any JS libraries that the app uses, including anything provided by a third-party framework, such as [Bootstrap JS](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

In a few documentation examples, JS interop is used to mutate an element *purely for demonstration purposes* as part of an example. In those cases, a warning appears in the text.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/js-interop/call-javascript-from-dotnet#capture-references-to-elements>.

## Asynchronous JavaScript calls

JS interop calls are asynchronous by default, regardless of whether the called code is synchronous or asynchronous. Calls are asynchronous by default to ensure that components are compatible across server-side and client-side rendering models. When adopting server-side rendering, JS interop calls must be asynchronous because they're sent over a network connection. For apps that exclusively adopt client-side rendering, synchronous JS interop calls are supported.

## Object serialization

Blazor uses <xref:System.Text.Json?displayProperty=fullName> for serialization with the following requirements and default behaviors:

* Types must have a default constructor, [`get`/`set` accessors](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-properties) must be public, and fields are never serialized.
* Global default serialization isn't customizable to avoid breaking existing component libraries, impacts on performance and security, and reductions in reliability.
* Serializing .NET member names results in lowercase JSON key names.
* JSON is deserialized as <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonElement> C# instances, which permit mixed casing. Internal casting for assignment to C# model properties works as expected in spite of any case differences between JSON key names and C# property names.

<xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverter> API is available for custom serialization. Properties can be annotated with a [`[JsonConverter]` attribute](xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverterAttribute) to override default serialization for an existing data type.

For more information, see the following resources in the .NET documentation:

* [JSON serialization and deserialization (marshalling and unmarshalling) in .NET](/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-overview)
* [How to customize property names and values with `System.Text.Json`](/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-customize-properties)
* [How to write custom converters for JSON serialization (marshalling) in .NET](/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-converters-how-to)

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

Blazor supports optimized byte array JS interop that avoids encoding/decoding byte arrays into Base64. The app can apply custom serialization and pass the resulting bytes. For more information, see <xref:blazor/js-interop/call-javascript-from-dotnet#byte-array-support>.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-5.0 < aspnetcore-7.0"

Blazor supports unmarshalled JS interop when a high volume of .NET objects are rapidly serialized or when large .NET objects or many .NET objects must be serialized. For more information, see <xref:blazor/js-interop/call-javascript-from-dotnet#unmarshalled-javascript-interop>.

## DOM cleanup tasks during component disposal

Don't execute JS interop code for DOM cleanup tasks during component disposal. Instead, use the [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) pattern in JavaScript (JS) on the client for the following reasons:

* The component may have been removed from the DOM by the time your cleanup code executes in `Dispose{Async}`.
* During server-side rendering, the Blazor renderer may have been disposed by the framework by the time your cleanup code executes in `Dispose{Async}`.

The [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) pattern allows you to run a function when an element is removed from the DOM.

In the following example, the `DOMCleanup` component:

* Contains a `<div>` with an `id` of `cleanupDiv`. The `<div>` element is removed from the DOM along with the rest of the component's DOM markup when the component is removed from the DOM.
* Loads the `DOMCleanup` JS class from the `DOMCleanup.razor.js` file and calls its `createObserver` function to set up the `MutationObserver` callback. These tasks are accomplished in the [`OnAfterRenderAsync` lifecycle method](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#after-component-render-onafterrenderasync).

`DOMCleanup.razor`:

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-8.0"

```razor
@page "/dom-cleanup"
@attribute [RenderModeServer]
@implements IAsyncDisposable
@inject IJSRuntime JS

<h1>DOM Cleanup Example</h1>

<div id="cleanupDiv"></div>

@code {
    private IJSObjectReference? jsModule;

    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
    {
        if (firstRender)
        {
            jsModule = await JS.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(
                "import", "./Components/Pages/DOMCleanup.razor.js");

            await jsModule.InvokeVoidAsync("DOMCleanup.createObserver");
        }
    }

    async ValueTask IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync()
    {
        if (jsModule is not null)
        {
            await jsModule.DisposeAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-8.0"

```razor
@page "/dom-cleanup"
@implements IAsyncDisposable
@inject IJSRuntime JS

<h1>DOM Cleanup Example</h1>

<div id="cleanupDiv"></div>

@code {
    private IJSObjectReference? jsModule;

    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
    {
        if (firstRender)
        {
            jsModule = await JS.InvokeAsync<IJSObjectReference>(
                "import", "./Pages/DOMCleanup.razor.js");

            await jsModule.InvokeVoidAsync("DOMCleanup.createObserver");
        }
    }

    async ValueTask IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync()
    {
        if (jsModule is not null)
        {
            await jsModule.DisposeAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

:::moniker-end

In the following example, the `MutationObserver` callback is executed each time a DOM change occurs. Execute your cleanup code when the `if` statement confirms that the target element (`cleanupDiv`) was removed (`if (targetRemoved) { ... }`). It's important to disconnect and delete the `MutationObserver` to avoid a memory leak after your cleanup code executes.

`DOMCleanup.razor.js` placed side-by-side with the preceding `DOMCleanup` component:

```javascript
export class DOMCleanup {
  static observer;

  static createObserver() {
    const target = document.querySelector('#cleanupDiv');

    this.observer = new MutationObserver(function (mutations) {
      const targetRemoved = mutations.some(function (mutation) {
        const nodes = Array.from(mutation.removedNodes);
        return nodes.indexOf(target) !== -1;
      });

      if (targetRemoved) {
        // Cleanup resources here
        // ...

        // Disconnect and delete MutationObserver
        this.observer && this.observer.disconnect();
        delete this.observer;
      }
    });

    this.observer.observe(target.parentNode, { childList: true });
  }
}

window.DOMCleanup = DOMCleanup;
```

## JavaScript interop calls without a circuit

*This section only applies to server-side apps.*

JavaScript (JS) interop calls can't be issued after a SignalR circuit is disconnected. Without a circuit during component disposal or at any other time that a circuit doesn't exist, the following method calls fail and log a message that the circuit is disconnected as a <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSDisconnectedException>:

* JS interop method calls
  * <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.IJSRuntime.InvokeAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
  * <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSRuntimeExtensions.InvokeAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
  * <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSRuntimeExtensions.InvokeVoidAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>)
* `Dispose`/`DisposeAsync` calls on any <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.IJSObjectReference>.

In order to avoid logging <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSDisconnectedException> or to log custom information, catch the exception in a [`try-catch`](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch) statement.

For the following component disposal example:

* The component implements <xref:System.IAsyncDisposable>.
* `objInstance` is an <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.IJSObjectReference>.
* <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSDisconnectedException> is caught and not logged.
* Optionally, you can log custom information in the `catch` statement at whatever log level you prefer. The following example doesn't log custom information because it assumes the developer doesn't care about when or where circuits are disconnected during component disposal.

```csharp
async ValueTask IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync()
{
    try
    {
        if (objInstance is not null)
        {
            await objInstance.DisposeAsync();
        }
    }
    catch (JSDisconnectedException)
    {
    }
}
```

If you must clean up your own JS objects or execute other JS code on the client after a circuit is lost, use the [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) pattern in JS on the client. The [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) pattern allows you to run a function when an element is removed from the DOM.

For more information, see the following articles:

* <xref:blazor/fundamentals/handle-errors#javascript-interop>: The *JavaScript interop* section discusses error handling in JS interop scenarios.
* <xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#component-disposal-with-idisposable-and-iasyncdisposable>: The *Component disposal with `IDisposable` and `IAsyncDisposable`* section describes how to implement disposal patterns in Razor components.

## JavaScript location

Load JavaScript (JS) code using any of the following approaches:

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

* [Load a script in `<head>` markup](#load-a-script-in-head-markup) (*Not generally recommended*)
* [Load a script in `<body>` markup](#load-a-script-in-body-markup)
* [Load a script from an external JavaScript file (`.js`) collocated with a component](#load-a-script-from-an-external-javascript-file-js-collocated-with-a-component)
* [Load a script from an external JavaScript file (`.js`)](#load-a-script-from-an-external-javascript-file-js)
* [Inject a script before or after Blazor starts](#inject-a-script-before-or-after-blazor-starts)

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-6.0"

* [Load a script in `<head>` markup](#load-a-script-in-head-markup) (*Not generally recommended*)
* [Load a script in `<body>` markup](#load-a-script-in-body-markup)
* [Load a script from an external JavaScript file (`.js`)](#load-a-script-from-an-external-javascript-file-js)
* [Inject a script after Blazor starts](#inject-a-script-after-blazor-starts)

:::moniker-end

> [!WARNING]
> Don't place a `<script>` tag in a Razor component file (`.razor`) because the `<script>` tag can't be updated dynamically by Blazor.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-5.0"

> [!NOTE]
> Documentation examples usually place scripts in a `<script>` tag or load global scripts from external files. These approaches pollute the client with global functions. For production apps, we recommend placing JavaScript into separate [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that can be imported when needed. For more information, see the [JavaScript isolation in JavaScript modules](#javascript-isolation-in-javascript-modules) section.

> [!NOTE]
> Documentation examples place scripts into a `<script>` tag or load global scripts from external files. These approaches pollute the client with global functions. Placing JavaScript into separate [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that can be imported when needed is **not** supported in Blazor earlier than ASP.NET Core 5.0. If the app requires the use of JS modules for JS isolation, we recommend using ASP.NET Core 5.0 or later to build the app. For more information, use the **Version** dropdown list to select a 5.0 or later version of this article and see the *JavaScript isolation in JavaScript modules* section.

:::moniker-end

### Load a script in `<head>` markup

*The approach in this section isn't generally recommended.*

Place the JavaScript (JS) tags (`<script>...</script>`) in the [`<head>` element markup](xref:blazor/project-structure#location-of-head-and-body-content):

```html
<head>
    ...

    <script>
      window.jsMethod = (methodParameter) => {
        ...
      };
    </script>
</head>
```

Loading JS from the `<head>` isn't the best approach for the following reasons:

* JS interop may fail if the script depends on Blazor. We recommend loading scripts using one of the other approaches, not via the `<head>` markup.
* The page may become interactive slower due to the time it takes to parse the JS in the script.

### Load a script in `<body>` markup

Place the JavaScript (JS) tags (`<script>...</script>`) inside the [closing `</body>` element](xref:blazor/project-structure#location-of-head-and-body-content) after the Blazor script reference:

```html
<body>
    ...

    <script src="{BLAZOR SCRIPT}"></script>
    <script>
      window.jsMethod = (methodParameter) => {
        ...
      };
    </script>
</body>
```

In the preceding example, the `{BLAZOR SCRIPT}` placeholder is the Blazor script path and file name.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

### Load a script from an external JavaScript file (`.js`) collocated with a component

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/js-collocation.md)]

For more information on RCLs, see <xref:blazor/components/class-libraries>.

:::moniker-end

### Load a script from an external JavaScript file (`.js`)

Place the JavaScript (JS) tags (`<script>...</script>`) with a script source (`src`) path inside the [closing `</body>` element](xref:blazor/project-structure#location-of-head-and-body-content) after the Blazor script reference:

```html
<body>
    ...

    <script src="{BLAZOR SCRIPT}"></script>
    <script src="{SCRIPT PATH AND FILE NAME (.js)}"></script>
</body>
```

In the preceding example, the `{BLAZOR SCRIPT}` placeholder is the Blazor script path and file name. The `{SCRIPT PATH AND FILE NAME (.js)}` placeholder is the path and script file name under `wwwroot`.

In the following example of the preceding `<script>` tag, the `scripts.js` file is in the `wwwroot/js` folder of the app:

```html
<script src="js/scripts.js"></script>
```

You can also serve scripts directly from the `wwwroot` folder if you prefer not to keep all of your scripts in a separate folder under `wwwroot`:

```html
<script src="scripts.js"></script>
```

When the external JS file is supplied by a [Razor class library](xref:blazor/components/class-libraries), specify the JS file using its stable static web asset path: `./_content/{PACKAGE ID}/{SCRIPT PATH AND FILE NAME (.js)}`:

* The path segment for the current directory (`./`) is required in order to create the correct static asset path to the JS file.
* The `{PACKAGE ID}` placeholder is the library's [package ID](/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package-msbuild#set-properties). The package ID defaults to the project's assembly name if `<PackageId>` isn't specified in the project file.
* The `{SCRIPT PATH AND FILE NAME (.js)}` placeholder is the path and file name under `wwwroot`.

```html
<body>
    ...

    <script src="{BLAZOR SCRIPT}"></script>
    <script src="./_content/{PACKAGE ID}/{SCRIPT PATH AND FILE NAME (.js)}"></script>
</body>
```

In the following example of the preceding `<script>` tag:

* The Razor class library has an assembly name of `ComponentLibrary`, and a `<PackageId>` isn't specified in the library's project file.
* The `scripts.js` file is in the class library's `wwwroot` folder.

```html
<script src="./_content/ComponentLibrary/scripts.js"></script>
```

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/class-libraries>.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

### Inject a script before or after Blazor starts

To ensure scripts load before or after Blazor starts, use a JavaScript initializer. For more information and examples, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/startup#javascript-initializers>.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-6.0"

### Inject a script after Blazor starts

To inject a script after Blazor starts, chain to the `Promise` that results from a manual start of Blazor. For more information and an example, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/startup#inject-a-script-after-blazor-starts>.

:::moniker-end

## JavaScript isolation in JavaScript modules

Blazor enables JavaScript (JS) isolation in standard [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) ([ECMAScript specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules)).

JS isolation provides the following benefits:

* Imported JS no longer pollutes the global namespace.
* Consumers of a library and components aren't required to import the related JS.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/js-interop/call-javascript-from-dotnet#javascript-isolation-in-javascript-modules>.

[Dynamic import with the `import()` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) is supported with ASP.NET Core and Blazor:

```javascript
if ({CONDITION}) import("/additionalModule.js");
```

In the preceding example, the `{CONDITION}` placeholder represents a conditional check to determine if the module should be loaded.

For browser compatibility, see [Can I use: JavaScript modules: dynamic import](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import).

## Cached JavaScript files

JavaScript (JS) files and other static assets aren't generally cached on clients during development in the [`Development` environment](xref:fundamentals/index#environments). During development, static asset requests include the [`Cache-Control` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) with a value of [`no-cache`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#cacheability) or [`max-age`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#expiration) with a value of zero (`0`).

During production in the [`Production` environment](xref:fundamentals/index#environments), JS files are usually cached by clients.

To disable client-side caching in browsers, developers usually adopt one of the following approaches:

* Disable caching when the browser's developer tools console is open. Guidance can be found in the developer tools documentation of each browser maintainer:
  * [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
  * [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools)
  * [Microsoft Edge Developer Tools overview](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/)
* Perform a manual browser refresh of any webpage of the Blazor app to reload JS files from the server. ASP.NET Core's HTTP Caching Middleware always honors a valid no-cache [`Cache-Control` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) sent by a client.

For more information, see:

* <xref:blazor/fundamentals/environments>
* <xref:performance/caching/response>

## Size limits on JavaScript interop calls

*This section only applies to interactive components in server-side apps. For client-side components, the framework doesn't impose a limit on the size of JavaScript (JS) interop inputs and outputs.*

For interactive components in server-side apps, JS interop calls passing data from the client to the server are limited in size by the maximum incoming SignalR message size permitted for hub methods, which is enforced by <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.HubOptions.MaximumReceiveMessageSize?displayProperty=nameWithType> (default: 32 KB). JS to .NET SignalR messages larger than <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.HubOptions.MaximumReceiveMessageSize> throw an error. The framework doesn't impose a limit on the size of a SignalR message from the hub to a client. For more information on the size limit, error messages, and guidance on dealing with message size limits, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/signalr#maximum-receive-message-size>.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

## Determine where the app is running

If it's relevant for the app to know where code is running for JS interop calls, use <xref:System.OperatingSystem.IsBrowser%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to determine if the component is executing in the context of browser on WebAssembly.
