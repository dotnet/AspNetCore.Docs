*This section applies to Blazor Server and hosted Blazor WebAssembly apps that prerender Razor components. Prerendering is covered in <xref:blazor/components/prerendering-and-integration>.*

While an app is prerendering, certain actions, such as calling into JavaScript, aren't possible. Components may need to render differently when prerendered.

For the following example, the `setElementText1` function is placed inside the `<head>` element. The function is called with <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSRuntimeExtensions.InvokeVoidAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and doesn't return a value.

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/js-location.md)]

```html
<script>
  window.setElementText1 = (element, text) => element.innerText = text;
</script>
```

> [!WARNING]
> **The preceding example modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) directly for demonstration purposes only.** Directly modifying the DOM with JavaScript isn't recommended in most scenarios because JavaScript can interfere with Blazor's change tracking. For more information, see <xref:blazor/js-interop/index#interaction-with-the-document-object-model-dom>.

To delay JavaScript interop calls until a point where such calls are guaranteed to work, override the [`OnAfterRender{Async}` lifecycle event](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#after-component-render-onafterrenderasync). This event is only called after the app is fully rendered.

The following component demonstrates how to use JavaScript interop as part of a component's initialization logic in a way that's compatible with prerendering. The component shows that it's possible to trigger a rendering update from inside <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase.OnAfterRenderAsync%2A>. The developer must be careful to avoid creating an infinite loop in this scenario.

For the following example, the `setElementText2` function is placed inside the `<head>` element. The function is called with <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.IJSRuntime.InvokeAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and returns a value.

[!INCLUDE[](~/blazor/includes/js-location.md)]

```html
<script>
  window.setElementText2 = (element, text) => {
    element.innerText = text;
    return text;
  };
</script>
```

For more information, see <xref:blazor/js-interop/index#interaction-with-the-document-object-model-dom>.

Where <xref:Microsoft.JSInterop.JSRuntime.InvokeAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is called, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ElementReference> is only used in <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase.OnAfterRenderAsync%2A> and not in any earlier lifecycle method because there's no JavaScript element until after the component is rendered.

[`StateHasChanged`](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#state-changes-statehaschanged) is called to rerender the component with the new state obtained from the JavaScript interop call (for more information, see <xref:blazor/components/rendering>). The code doesn't create an infinite loop because `StateHasChanged` is only called when `data` is `null`.
