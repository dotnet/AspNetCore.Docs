JavaScript (JS) initializers execute logic before and after a Blazor app loads. JS initializers are useful in the following scenarios:

* Customizing how a Blazor app loads.
* Initializing libraries before Blazor starts up.
* Configuring Blazor settings.

JS initializers are detected as part of the build process and imported automatically in Blazor apps. Use of JS initializers often removes the need to [manually trigger script functions from the app](xref:blazor/fundamentals/startup#chain-to-the-promise-that-results-from-a-manual-start) when using [Razor class libraries (RCLs)](xref:blazor/components/class-libraries).

To define a JS initializer, add a JS module to the project named `{NAME}.lib.module.js`, where the `{NAME}` placeholder is the assembly name, library name, or package identifier. Place the file in the project's web root, which is typically the `wwwroot` folder.

The module exports either or both of the following conventional functions:

* `beforeStart(options, extensions)`: Called before Blazor starts. For example, `beforeStart` is used to customize the loading process, logging level, and other options specific to the hosting model.
  * In Blazor WebAssembly, `beforeStart` receives the Blazor WebAssembly options (`options` in this section's example) and any extensions (`extensions` in this section's example) added during publishing. For example, options can specify the use of a custom [boot resource loader](xref:blazor/fundamentals/startup#load-boot-resources).
  * In Blazor Server, `beforeStart` receives SignalR circuit start options (`options` in this section's example).
  * In [`BlazorWebViews`](/mobile-blazor-bindings/walkthroughs/hybrid-hello-world#mainrazor-native-ui-page), no options are passed.
* `afterStarted`: Called after Blazor is ready to receive calls from JS. For example, `afterStarted` is used to initialize libraries by making JS interop calls and registering custom elements. The Blazor instance is passed to `afterStarted` as an argument (`blazor` in this section's example).

The following example demonstrates JS initializers for `beforeStart` and `afterStarted`. For the filename of the following example:

* Use the app's assembly name in the filename if the JS initializers are consumed as a static asset in the project. For example, name the file `BlazorSample.lib.module.js` for a project with an assembly name of `BlazorSample`. Place the file in the app's `wwwroot` folder.
* Use the project's library name or package identifier if the JS initializers are consumed from an RCL. For example, name the file `RazorClassLibrary1.lib.module.js` for an RCL with a package identifier of `RazorClassLibrary1`. Place the file in the library's `wwwroot` folder.

```javascript
export function beforeStart(options, extensions) {
    console.log("beforeStart");
}

export function afterStarted(blazor) {
    console.log("afterStarted");
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> MVC and Razor Pages apps don't automatically load JS initializers. However, developer code can include a script to fetch the app's manifest and trigger the load of the JS initializers.
