# ASP.NET Core Web SDK

### Overview

`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` is an [MSBuild project SDK](/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk) for building ASP.NET Core apps. It's possible to build an ASP.NET Core app without this SDK, however, the Web SDK is:

* Tailored towards providing a first-class experience.
* The recommended target for most users.

Use the Web.SDK in a project:

  ```xml
  <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
    <!-- omitted for brevity -->
  </Project>
  ```

Features enabled by using the Web SDK:

* Projects targeting .NET Core 3.0 or later implicitly reference:

  * The [ASP.NET Core shared framework](xref:fundamentals/metapackage-app).
  * [Analyzers](/visualstudio/extensibility/getting-started-with-roslyn-analyzers) designed for building ASP.NET Core apps.
* The Web SDK imports MSBuild targets that enable the use of publish profiles and publishing using WebDeploy.
