# Razor Pages route and app conventions in ASP.NET Core

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

Learn how to use page [route and app model provider conventions](xref:mvc/controllers/application-model#conventions) to control page routing, discovery, and processing in Razor Pages apps.

To specify a page route, add route segments, or add parameters to a route, use the page's `@page` directive. For more information, see [Custom routes](xref:razor-pages/index#custom-routes).

There are reserved words that can't be used as route segments or parameter names. For more information, see [Routing: Reserved routing names](xref:mvc/controllers/routing#reserved-routing-names).

Razor Pages conventions are configured using an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.AddRazorPages%2A> overload that configures <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions>. The following convention examples are explained later in this topic:

```csharp

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRazorPages(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions.Add( ... );
        options.Conventions.AddFolderRouteModelConvention(
            "/OtherPages", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.AddPageRouteModelConvention(
            "/About", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.AddPageRoute(
            "/Contact", "TheContactPage/{text?}");
        options.Conventions.AddFolderApplicationModelConvention(
            "/OtherPages", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.AddPageApplicationModelConvention(
            "/About", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter(model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter( ... );
    });
}
```

## Route order

Routes specify an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> for processing (route matching).

| Route order            | Behavior |
| :--------------: | -------- |
| -1               | The route is processed before other routes are processed. |
| 0                | Order isn't specified (default value). Not assigning `Order` (`Order = null`) defaults the route `Order` to 0 (zero) for processing. |
| 1, 2, &hellip; n | Specifies the route processing order. |

Route processing is established by convention:

* Routes are processed in sequential order (-1, 0, 1, 2, &hellip; n).
* When routes have the same `Order`, the most specific route is matched first followed by less specific routes.
* When routes with the same `Order` and the same number of parameters match a request URL, routes are processed in the order that they're added to the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection>.

If possible, avoid depending on an established route processing order. Generally, routing selects the correct route with URL matching. If you must set route `Order` properties to route requests correctly, the app's routing scheme is probably confusing to clients and fragile to maintain. Seek to simplify the app's routing scheme. The sample app requires an explicit route processing order to demonstrate several routing scenarios using a single app. However, you should attempt to avoid the practice of setting route `Order` in production apps.

Razor Pages routing and MVC controller routing share an implementation. Information on route order in the MVC topics is available at [Routing to controller actions: Ordering attribute routes](xref:mvc/controllers/routing#routing-ordering-ref-label).

## Model conventions

Add a delegate for <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> to add [model conventions](xref:mvc/controllers/application-model#conventions) that apply to Razor Pages.

### Add a route model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page route model construction.

The sample app contains the `GlobalTemplatePageRouteModelConvention` class to add a `{globalTemplate?}` route template to all of the pages in the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalTemplatePageRouteModelConvention.cs?highlight=17-19)]

In the preceding code:

* The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel> is passed to the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention.Apply%2A> method.
* The [PageRouteModel.Selectors](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel.Selectors) gets the count of selectors.
* A new <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.SelectorModel> is added which contains a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel>

Razor Pages options, such as adding <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions>, are added when Razor Pages is added to the service collection. For an example, see the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions/samples/).

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet11&highlight=13,15,28,34,47-49)]

Consider the `GlobalTemplatePageRouteModelConvention` class:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalTemplatePageRouteModelConvention.cs?highlight=16-19)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `1`. This ensures the following route matching behavior in the sample app:

* A route template for `TheContactPage/{text?}` is added later in this topic. The `Contact Page` route has a default order of `null` (`Order = 0`), so it matches before the `{globalTemplate?}` route template which has `Order = 1`.
* The `{aboutTemplate?}` route template is show in the preceding code. The `{aboutTemplate?}` template is given an `Order` of `2`. When the About page is requested at `/About/RouteDataValue`, "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["aboutTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.
* The `{otherPagesTemplate?}` route template is shown in the preceding code. The `{otherPagesTemplate?}` template is given an `Order` of `2`. When any page in the *Pages/OtherPages* folder is requested with a route parameter:

* For example, `/OtherPages/Page1/xyz`
* The route data value `"xyz"` is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`).
* `RouteData.Values["otherPagesTemplate"]` with (`Order = 2`) is not loaded due to the `Order` property `2` having a higher value.

**When possible, don't set the `Order`**. When `Order` is not set, it defaults to `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route rather than the `Order` property.

Request the sample's `About` page at `localhost:{port}/About/GlobalRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![The About page is requested with a route segment of GlobalRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data value is captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-template.png)

The sample app uses the [Rick.Docs.Samples.RouteInfo](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rick.Docs.Samples.RouteInfo) NuGet package to display routing information in the logging output. Using `localhost:{port}/About/GlobalRouteValue`, the logger displays the request, the `Order`, and the template used:

```dotnetcli
info: SampleApp.Pages.AboutModel[0]
       /About/GlobalRouteValue   Order = 1 Template = About/{globalTemplate?}
```

### Add an app model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page app model construction.

To demonstrate this and other conventions later in the topic, the sample app includes an `AddHeaderAttribute` class. The class constructor accepts a `name` string and a `values` string array. These values are used in its `OnResultExecuting` method to set a response header. The full class is shown in the [Page model action conventions](#page-model-action-conventions) section later in the topic.

The sample app uses the `AddHeaderAttribute` class to add a header, `GlobalHeader`, to all of the pages in the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalHeaderPageApplicationModelConvention.cs?name=snippet1)]

`Program.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet2)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:{port}/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that the GlobalHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-header.png)

### Add a handler model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageHandlerModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page handler model construction.

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalPageHandlerModelConvention.cs?name=snippet1)]

## Page route action conventions

The default route model provider that derives from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelProvider> invokes conventions which are designed to provide extensibility points for configuring page routes.

### Folder route model convention

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderRouteModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel> for all of the pages under the specified folder.

The sample app uses <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderRouteModelConvention*> to add an `{otherPagesTemplate?}` route template to the pages in the *OtherPages* folder:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet3)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `2`. This ensures that the template for `{globalTemplate?}` (set earlier in the topic to `1`) is given priority for the first route data value position when a single route value is provided. If a page in the *Pages/OtherPages* folder is requested with a route parameter value (for example, `/OtherPages/Page1/RouteDataValue`), "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["otherPagesTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Request the sample's Page1 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page1/GlobalRouteValue/OtherPagesRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![Page1 in the OtherPages folder is requested with a route segment of GlobalRouteValue and OtherPagesRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data values are captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/otherpages-page1-global-and-otherpages-templates.png)

### Page route model convention

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddPageRouteModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel> for the page with the specified name.

The sample app uses `AddPageRouteModelConvention` to add an `{aboutTemplate?}` route template to the About page:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet4)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `2`. This ensures that the template for `{globalTemplate?}` (set earlier in the topic to `1`) is given priority for the first route data value position when a single route value is provided. If the About page is requested with a route parameter value at `/About/RouteDataValue`, "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["aboutTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:{port}/About/GlobalRouteValue/AboutRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![About page is requested with route segments for GlobalRouteValue and AboutRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data values are captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-and-about-templates.png)

The logger output displays:

```dotnetcli
info: SampleApp.Pages.AboutModel[0]
       /About/GlobalRouteValue/AboutRouteValue   Order = 2 Template = About/{globalTemplate?}/{aboutTemplate?}
```

## Use a parameter transformer to customize page routes

See [Parameter transformers](xref:fundamentals/routing#parameter-transformers).

## Configure a page route

Use <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.AddPageRoute*> to configure a route to a page at the specified page path. Generated links to the page use the specified route. <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.AddPageRoute%2A> uses <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddPageRouteModelConvention%2A> to establish the route.

The sample app creates a route to `/TheContactPage` for the `Contact` Razor Page:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet5)]

The `Contact` page can also be reached at `/`Contact1` via its default route.

The sample app's custom route to the `Contact` page allows for an optional `text` route segment (`{text?}`). The page also includes this optional segment in its `@page` directive in case the visitor accesses the page at its `/Contact` route:

[!code-cshtml[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Pages/Contact.cshtml?highlight=1)]

Note that the URL generated for the **Contact** link in the rendered page reflects the updated route:

![Sample app Contact link in the navigation bar](razor-pages-conventions/_static/contact-link.png)

![Inspecting the Contact link in the rendered HTML indicates that the href is set to '/TheContactPage'](razor-pages-conventions/_static/contact-link-source.png)

Visit the `Contact` page at either its ordinary route, `/Contact`, or the custom route, `/TheContactPage`. If you supply an additional `text` route segment, the page shows the HTML-encoded segment that you provide:

![Edge browser example of supplying an optional 'text' route segment of 'TextValue' in the URL. The rendered page shows the 'text' segment value.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/route-segment-with-custom-route.png)

## Page model action conventions

The default page model provider that implements <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelProvider> invokes conventions which are designed to provide extensibility points for configuring page models. These conventions are useful when building and modifying page discovery and processing scenarios.

For the examples in this section, the sample app uses an `AddHeaderAttribute` class, which is a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.ResultFilterAttribute>, that applies a response header:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Filters/AddHeader.cs?name=snippet1)]

Using conventions, the sample demonstrates how to apply the attribute to all of the pages in a folder and to a single page.

**Folder app model convention**

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderApplicationModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> that invokes an action on <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageApplicationModel> instances for all pages under the specified folder.

The sample demonstrates the use of `AddFolderApplicationModelConvention` by adding a header, `OtherPagesHeader`, to the pages inside the *OtherPages* folder of the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet6)]

Request the sample's Page1 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page1` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the OtherPages/Page1 page show that the OtherPagesHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/page1-otherpages-header.png)

**Page app model convention**

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddPageApplicationModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageApplicationModel> for the page with the specified name.

The sample demonstrates the use of `AddPageApplicationModelConvention` by adding a header, `AboutHeader`, to the About page:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet7)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that the AboutHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-about-header.png)

**Configure a filter**

<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.ConfigureFilter*> configures the specified filter to apply. You can implement a filter class, but the sample app shows how to implement a filter in a lambda expression, which is implemented behind-the-scenes as a factory that returns a filter:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet8)]

The page app model is used to check the relative path for segments that lead to the Page2 page in the *OtherPages* folder. If the condition passes, a header is added. If not, the `EmptyFilter` is applied.

`EmptyFilter` is an [Action filter](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#action-filters). Since Action filters are ignored by Razor Pages, the `EmptyFilter` has no effect as intended if the path doesn't contain `OtherPages/Page2`.

Request the sample's Page2 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page2` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![The OtherPagesPage2Header is added to the response for Page2.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/page2-filter-header.png)

**Configure a filter factory**

<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.ConfigureFilter*> configures the specified factory to apply [filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters) to all Razor Pages.

The sample app provides an example of using a [filter factory](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#ifilterfactory) by adding a header, `FilterFactoryHeader`, with two values to the app's pages:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/6.x/SampleApp/Program.cs?name=snippet9)]

`AddHeaderWithFactory.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Factories/AddHeaderWithFactory.cs?name=snippet1)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that two FilterFactoryHeader headers have been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-filter-factory-header.png)

## MVC Filters and the Page filter (IPageFilter)

MVC [Action filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#action-filters) are ignored by Razor Pages, since Razor Pages use handler methods. Other types of MVC filters are available for you to use: [Authorization](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#authorization-filters), [Exception](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#exception-filters), [Resource](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#resource-filters), and [Result](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#result-filters). For more information, see the [Filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters) topic.

The Page filter (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.IPageFilter>) is a filter that applies to Razor Pages. For more information, see [Filter methods for Razor Pages](xref:razor-pages/filter).

Learn how to use page [route and app model provider conventions](xref:mvc/controllers/application-model#conventions) to control page routing, discovery, and processing in Razor Pages apps.

When you need to configure custom page routes for individual pages, configure routing to pages with the [AddPageRoute convention](#configure-a-page-route) described later in this topic.

To specify a page route, add route segments, or add parameters to a route, use the page's `@page` directive. For more information, see [Custom routes](xref:razor-pages/index#custom-routes).

There are reserved words that can't be used as route segments or parameter names. For more information, see [Routing: Reserved routing names](xref:mvc/controllers/routing#reserved-routing-names).

Razor Pages conventions are configured using an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.AddRazorPages%2A> overload that configures <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions> in `Startup.ConfigureServices`. The following convention examples are explained later in this topic:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions.Add( ... );
        options.Conventions.AddFolderRouteModelConvention(
            "/OtherPages", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.AddPageRouteModelConvention(
            "/About", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.AddPageRoute(
            "/Contact", "TheContactPage/{text?}");
        options.Conventions.AddFolderApplicationModelConvention(
            "/OtherPages", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.AddPageApplicationModelConvention(
            "/About", model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter(model => { ... });
        options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter( ... );
    });
}
```

## Route order

Routes specify an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> for processing (route matching).

| Order            | Behavior |
| :--------------: | -------- |
| -1               | The route is processed before other routes are processed. |
| 0                | Order isn't specified (default value). Not assigning `Order` (`Order = null`) defaults the route `Order` to 0 (zero) for processing. |
| 1, 2, &hellip; n | Specifies the route processing order. |

Route processing is established by convention:

* Routes are processed in sequential order (-1, 0, 1, 2, &hellip; n).
* When routes have the same `Order`, the most specific route is matched first followed by less specific routes.
* When routes with the same `Order` and the same number of parameters match a request URL, routes are processed in the order that they're added to the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection>.

If possible, avoid depending on an established route processing order. Generally, routing selects the correct route with URL matching. If you must set route `Order` properties to route requests correctly, the app's routing scheme is probably confusing to clients and fragile to maintain. Seek to simplify the app's routing scheme. The sample app requires an explicit route processing order to demonstrate several routing scenarios using a single app. However, you should attempt to avoid the practice of setting route `Order` in production apps.

Razor Pages routing and MVC controller routing share an implementation. Information on route order in the MVC topics is available at [Routing to controller actions: Ordering attribute routes](xref:mvc/controllers/routing#routing-ordering-ref-label).

## Model conventions

Add a delegate for <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> to add [model conventions](xref:mvc/controllers/application-model#conventions) that apply to Razor Pages.

### Add a route model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page route model construction.

The sample app adds a `{globalTemplate?}` route template to all of the pages in the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalTemplatePageRouteModelConvention.cs?name=snippet1)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `1`. This ensures the following route matching behavior in the sample app:

* A route template for `TheContactPage/{text?}` is added later in the topic. The Contact Page route has a default order of `null` (`Order = 0`), so it matches before the `{globalTemplate?}` route template.
* An `{aboutTemplate?}` route template is added later in the topic. The `{aboutTemplate?}` template is given an `Order` of `2`. When the About page is requested at `/About/RouteDataValue`, "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["aboutTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.
* An `{otherPagesTemplate?}` route template is added later in the topic. The `{otherPagesTemplate?}` template is given an `Order` of `2`. When any page in the *Pages/OtherPages* folder is requested with a route parameter (for example, `/OtherPages/Page1/RouteDataValue`), "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["otherPagesTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Razor Pages options, such as adding <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions>, are added when Razor Pages is added to the service collection in `Startup.ConfigureServices`. For an example, see the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions/samples/).

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet1)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About/GlobalRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![The About page is requested with a route segment of GlobalRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data value is captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-template.png)

### Add an app model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page app model construction.

To demonstrate this and other conventions later in the topic, the sample app includes an `AddHeaderAttribute` class. The class constructor accepts a `name` string and a `values` string array. These values are used in its `OnResultExecuting` method to set a response header. The full class is shown in the [Page model action conventions](#page-model-action-conventions) section later in the topic.

The sample app uses the `AddHeaderAttribute` class to add a header, `GlobalHeader`, to all of the pages in the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalHeaderPageApplicationModelConvention.cs?name=snippet1)]

`Startup.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet2)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that the GlobalHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-header.png)

### Add a handler model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageHandlerModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page handler model construction.

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalPageHandlerModelConvention.cs?name=snippet1)]

`Startup.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet10)]

## Page route action conventions

The default route model provider that derives from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelProvider> invokes conventions which are designed to provide extensibility points for configuring page routes.

### Folder route model convention

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderRouteModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel> for all of the pages under the specified folder.

The sample app uses <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderRouteModelConvention*> to add an `{otherPagesTemplate?}` route template to the pages in the *OtherPages* folder:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet3)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `2`. This ensures that the template for `{globalTemplate?}` (set earlier in the topic to `1`) is given priority for the first route data value position when a single route value is provided. If a page in the *Pages/OtherPages* folder is requested with a route parameter value (for example, `/OtherPages/Page1/RouteDataValue`), "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["otherPagesTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Request the sample's Page1 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page1/GlobalRouteValue/OtherPagesRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![Page1 in the OtherPages folder is requested with a route segment of GlobalRouteValue and OtherPagesRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data values are captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/otherpages-page1-global-and-otherpages-templates.png)

### Page route model convention

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddPageRouteModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel> for the page with the specified name.

The sample app uses `AddPageRouteModelConvention` to add an `{aboutTemplate?}` route template to the About page:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet4)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `2`. This ensures that the template for `{globalTemplate?}` (set earlier in the topic to `1`) is given priority for the first route data value position when a single route value is provided. If the About page is requested with a route parameter value at `/About/RouteDataValue`, "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["aboutTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About/GlobalRouteValue/AboutRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![About page is requested with route segments for GlobalRouteValue and AboutRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data values are captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-and-about-templates.png)

## Use a parameter transformer to customize page routes

Page routes generated by ASP.NET Core can be customized using a parameter transformer. A parameter transformer implements `IOutboundParameterTransformer` and transforms the value of parameters. For example, a custom `SlugifyParameterTransformer` parameter transformer changes the `SubscriptionManagement` route value to `subscription-management`.

The `PageRouteTransformerConvention` page route model convention applies a parameter transformer to the folder and file name segments of automatically generated page routes in an app. For example, the Razor Pages file at `/Pages/SubscriptionManagement/ViewAll.cshtml` would have its route rewritten from `/SubscriptionManagement/ViewAll` to `/subscription-management/view-all`.

`PageRouteTransformerConvention` only transforms the automatically generated segments of a page route that come from the Razor Pages folder and file name. It doesn't transform route segments added with the `@page` directive. The convention also doesn't transform routes added by <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.AddPageRoute*>.

The `PageRouteTransformerConvention` is registered as an option in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions.Add(
            new PageRouteTransformerConvention(
                new SlugifyParameterTransformer()));
    });
}
```

[!code-csharp[](~/mvc/controllers/routing/samples/3.x/main/StartupSlugifyParamTransformer.cs?name=snippet2)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/regex.md)]

## Configure a page route

Use <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.AddPageRoute*> to configure a route to a page at the specified page path. Generated links to the page use your specified route. `AddPageRoute` uses `AddPageRouteModelConvention` to establish the route.

The sample app creates a route to `/TheContactPage` for `Contact.cshtml`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet5)]

The Contact page can also be reached at `/Contact` via its default route.

The sample app's custom route to the Contact page allows for an optional `text` route segment (`{text?}`). The page also includes this optional segment in its `@page` directive in case the visitor accesses the page at its `/Contact` route:

[!code-cshtml[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Pages/Contact.cshtml?highlight=1)]

Note that the URL generated for the **Contact** link in the rendered page reflects the updated route:

![Sample app Contact link in the navigation bar](razor-pages-conventions/_static/contact-link.png)

![Inspecting the Contact link in the rendered HTML indicates that the href is set to '/TheContactPage'](razor-pages-conventions/_static/contact-link-source.png)

Visit the Contact page at either its ordinary route, `/Contact`, or the custom route, `/TheContactPage`. If you supply an additional `text` route segment, the page shows the HTML-encoded segment that you provide:

![Edge browser example of supplying an optional 'text' route segment of 'TextValue' in the URL. The rendered page shows the 'text' segment value.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/route-segment-with-custom-route.png)

## Page model action conventions

The default page model provider that implements <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelProvider> invokes conventions which are designed to provide extensibility points for configuring page models. These conventions are useful when building and modifying page discovery and processing scenarios.

For the examples in this section, the sample app uses an `AddHeaderAttribute` class, which is a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.ResultFilterAttribute>, that applies a response header:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Filters/AddHeader.cs?name=snippet1)]

Using conventions, the sample demonstrates how to apply the attribute to all of the pages in a folder and to a single page.

**Folder app model convention**

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderApplicationModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> that invokes an action on <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageApplicationModel> instances for all pages under the specified folder.

The sample demonstrates the use of `AddFolderApplicationModelConvention` by adding a header, `OtherPagesHeader`, to the pages inside the *OtherPages* folder of the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet6)]

Request the sample's Page1 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page1` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the OtherPages/Page1 page show that the OtherPagesHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/page1-otherpages-header.png)

**Page app model convention**

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddPageApplicationModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageApplicationModel> for the page with the specified name.

The sample demonstrates the use of `AddPageApplicationModelConvention` by adding a header, `AboutHeader`, to the About page:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet7)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that the AboutHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-about-header.png)

**Configure a filter**

<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.ConfigureFilter*> configures the specified filter to apply. You can implement a filter class, but the sample app shows how to implement a filter in a lambda expression, which is implemented behind-the-scenes as a factory that returns a filter:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet8)]

The page app model is used to check the relative path for segments that lead to the Page2 page in the *OtherPages* folder. If the condition passes, a header is added. If not, the `EmptyFilter` is applied.

`EmptyFilter` is an [Action filter](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#action-filters). Since Action filters are ignored by Razor Pages, the `EmptyFilter` has no effect as intended if the path doesn't contain `OtherPages/Page2`.

Request the sample's Page2 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page2` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![The OtherPagesPage2Header is added to the response for Page2.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/page2-filter-header.png)

**Configure a filter factory**

<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.ConfigureFilter*> configures the specified factory to apply [filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters) to all Razor Pages.

The sample app provides an example of using a [filter factory](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#ifilterfactory) by adding a header, `FilterFactoryHeader`, with two values to the app's pages:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet9)]

`AddHeaderWithFactory.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Factories/AddHeaderWithFactory.cs?name=snippet1)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that two FilterFactoryHeader headers have been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-filter-factory-header.png)

## MVC Filters and the Page filter (IPageFilter)

MVC [Action filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#action-filters) are ignored by Razor Pages, since Razor Pages use handler methods. Other types of MVC filters are available for you to use: [Authorization](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#authorization-filters), [Exception](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#exception-filters), [Resource](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#resource-filters), and [Result](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#result-filters). For more information, see the [Filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters) topic.

The Page filter (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.IPageFilter>) is a filter that applies to Razor Pages. For more information, see [Filter methods for Razor Pages](xref:razor-pages/filter).

Learn how to use page [route and app model provider conventions](xref:mvc/controllers/application-model#conventions) to control page routing, discovery, and processing in Razor Pages apps.

When you need to configure custom page routes for individual pages, configure routing to pages with the [AddPageRoute convention](#configure-a-page-route) described later in this topic.

To specify a page route, add route segments, or add parameters to a route, use the page's `@page` directive. For more information, see [Custom routes](xref:razor-pages/index#custom-routes).

There are reserved words that can't be used as route segments or parameter names. For more information, see [Routing: Reserved routing names](xref:fundamentals/routing#reserved-routing-names).

Razor Pages conventions are added and configured using the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MvcRazorPagesMvcBuilderExtensions.AddRazorPagesOptions*> extension method to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.AddMvc*> on the service collection in the `Startup` class. The following convention examples are explained later in this topic:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc()
        .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>
        {
            options.Conventions.Add( ... );
            options.Conventions.AddFolderRouteModelConvention(
                "/OtherPages", model => { ... });
            options.Conventions.AddPageRouteModelConvention(
                "/About", model => { ... });
            options.Conventions.AddPageRoute(
                "/Contact", "TheContactPage/{text?}");
            options.Conventions.AddFolderApplicationModelConvention(
                "/OtherPages", model => { ... });
            options.Conventions.AddPageApplicationModelConvention(
                "/About", model => { ... });
            options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter(model => { ... });
            options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter( ... );
        });
}
```

## Route order

Routes specify an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> for processing (route matching).

| Order            | Behavior |
| :--------------: | -------- |
| -1               | The route is processed before other routes are processed. |
| 0                | Order isn't specified (default value). Not assigning `Order` (`Order = null`) defaults the route `Order` to 0 (zero) for processing. |
| 1, 2, &hellip; n | Specifies the route processing order. |

Route processing is established by convention:

* Routes are processed in sequential order (-1, 0, 1, 2, &hellip; n).
* When routes have the same `Order`, the most specific route is matched first followed by less specific routes.
* When routes with the same `Order` and the same number of parameters match a request URL, routes are processed in the order that they're added to the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection>.

If possible, avoid depending on an established route processing order. Generally, routing selects the correct route with URL matching. If you must set route `Order` properties to route requests correctly, the app's routing scheme is probably confusing to clients and fragile to maintain. Seek to simplify the app's routing scheme. The sample app requires an explicit route processing order to demonstrate several routing scenarios using a single app. However, you should attempt to avoid the practice of setting route `Order` in production apps.

Razor Pages routing and MVC controller routing share an implementation. Information on route order in the MVC topics is available at [Routing to controller actions: Ordering attribute routes](xref:mvc/controllers/routing#routing-ordering-ref-label).

## Model conventions

Add a delegate for <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> to add [model conventions](xref:mvc/controllers/application-model#conventions) that apply to Razor Pages.

### Add a route model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page route model construction.

The sample app adds a `{globalTemplate?}` route template to all of the pages in the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalTemplatePageRouteModelConvention.cs?name=snippet1)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `1`. This ensures the following route matching behavior in the sample app:

* A route template for `TheContactPage/{text?}` is added later in the topic. The Contact Page route has a default order of `null` (`Order = 0`), so it matches before the `{globalTemplate?}` route template.
* An `{aboutTemplate?}` route template is added later in the topic. The `{aboutTemplate?}` template is given an `Order` of `2`. When the About page is requested at `/About/RouteDataValue`, "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["aboutTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.
* An `{otherPagesTemplate?}` route template is added later in the topic. The `{otherPagesTemplate?}` template is given an `Order` of `2`. When any page in the *Pages/OtherPages* folder is requested with a route parameter (for example, `/OtherPages/Page1/RouteDataValue`), "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["otherPagesTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Razor Pages options, such as adding <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions>, are added when MVC is added to the service collection in `Startup.ConfigureServices`. For an example, see the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions/samples/).

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet1)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About/GlobalRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![The About page is requested with a route segment of GlobalRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data value is captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-template.png)

### Add an app model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page app model construction.

To demonstrate this and other conventions later in the topic, the sample app includes an `AddHeaderAttribute` class. The class constructor accepts a `name` string and a `values` string array. These values are used in its `OnResultExecuting` method to set a response header. The full class is shown in the [Page model action conventions](#page-model-action-conventions) section later in the topic.

The sample app uses the `AddHeaderAttribute` class to add a header, `GlobalHeader`, to all of the pages in the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Conventions/GlobalHeaderPageApplicationModelConvention.cs?name=snippet1)]

`Startup.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet2)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that the GlobalHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-header.png)

### Add a handler model convention to all pages

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.RazorPagesOptions.Conventions> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageHandlerModelConvention> to the collection of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageConvention> instances that are applied during page handler model construction.

## Page route action conventions

The default route model provider that derives from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelProvider> invokes conventions which are designed to provide extensibility points for configuring page routes.

### Folder route model convention

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderRouteModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel> for all of the pages under the specified folder.

The sample app uses <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderRouteModelConvention*> to add an `{otherPagesTemplate?}` route template to the pages in the *OtherPages* folder:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet3)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `2`. This ensures that the template for `{globalTemplate?}` (set earlier in the topic to `1`) is given priority for the first route data value position when a single route value is provided. If a page in the *Pages/OtherPages* folder is requested with a route parameter value (for example, `/OtherPages/Page1/RouteDataValue`), "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["otherPagesTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Request the sample's Page1 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page1/GlobalRouteValue/OtherPagesRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![Page1 in the OtherPages folder is requested with a route segment of GlobalRouteValue and OtherPagesRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data values are captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/otherpages-page1-global-and-otherpages-templates.png)

### Page route model convention

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddPageRouteModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageRouteModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageRouteModel> for the page with the specified name.

The sample app uses `AddPageRouteModelConvention` to add an `{aboutTemplate?}` route template to the About page:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet4)]

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel.Order*> property for the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.AttributeRouteModel> is set to `2`. This ensures that the template for `{globalTemplate?}` (set earlier in the topic to `1`) is given priority for the first route data value position when a single route value is provided. If the About page is requested with a route parameter value at `/About/RouteDataValue`, "RouteDataValue" is loaded into `RouteData.Values["globalTemplate"]` (`Order = 1`) and not `RouteData.Values["aboutTemplate"]` (`Order = 2`) due to setting the `Order` property.

Wherever possible, don't set the `Order`, which results in `Order = 0`. Rely on routing to select the correct route.

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About/GlobalRouteValue/AboutRouteValue` and inspect the result:

![About page is requested with route segments for GlobalRouteValue and AboutRouteValue. The rendered page shows that the route data values are captured in the OnGet method of the page.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-global-and-about-templates.png)

## Configure a page route

Use <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.AddPageRoute*> to configure a route to a page at the specified page path. Generated links to the page use your specified route. `AddPageRoute` uses `AddPageRouteModelConvention` to establish the route.

The sample app creates a route to `/TheContactPage` for `Contact.cshtml`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet5)]

The Contact page can also be reached at `/Contact` via its default route.

The sample app's custom route to the Contact page allows for an optional `text` route segment (`{text?}`). The page also includes this optional segment in its `@page` directive in case the visitor accesses the page at its `/Contact` route:

[!code-cshtml[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Pages/Contact.cshtml?highlight=1)]

Note that the URL generated for the **Contact** link in the rendered page reflects the updated route:

![Sample app Contact link in the navigation bar](razor-pages-conventions/_static/contact-link.png)

![Inspecting the Contact link in the rendered HTML indicates that the href is set to '/TheContactPage'](razor-pages-conventions/_static/contact-link-source.png)

Visit the Contact page at either its ordinary route, `/Contact`, or the custom route, `/TheContactPage`. If you supply an additional `text` route segment, the page shows the HTML-encoded segment that you provide:

![Edge browser example of supplying an optional 'text' route segment of 'TextValue' in the URL. The rendered page shows the 'text' segment value.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/route-segment-with-custom-route.png)

## Page model action conventions

The default page model provider that implements <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelProvider> invokes conventions which are designed to provide extensibility points for configuring page models. These conventions are useful when building and modifying page discovery and processing scenarios.

For the examples in this section, the sample app uses an `AddHeaderAttribute` class, which is a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.ResultFilterAttribute>, that applies a response header:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Filters/AddHeader.cs?name=snippet1)]

Using conventions, the sample demonstrates how to apply the attribute to all of the pages in a folder and to a single page.

**Folder app model convention**

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddFolderApplicationModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> that invokes an action on <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageApplicationModel> instances for all pages under the specified folder.

The sample demonstrates the use of `AddFolderApplicationModelConvention` by adding a header, `OtherPagesHeader`, to the pages inside the *OtherPages* folder of the app:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet6)]

Request the sample's Page1 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page1` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the OtherPages/Page1 page show that the OtherPagesHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/page1-otherpages-header.png)

**Page app model convention**

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageConventionCollection.AddPageApplicationModelConvention*> to create and add an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.IPageApplicationModelConvention> that invokes an action on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApplicationModels.PageApplicationModel> for the page with the specified name.

The sample demonstrates the use of `AddPageApplicationModelConvention` by adding a header, `AboutHeader`, to the About page:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet7)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that the AboutHeader has been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-about-header.png)

**Configure a filter**

<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.ConfigureFilter*> configures the specified filter to apply. You can implement a filter class, but the sample app shows how to implement a filter in a lambda expression, which is implemented behind-the-scenes as a factory that returns a filter:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet8)]

The page app model is used to check the relative path for segments that lead to the Page2 page in the *OtherPages* folder. If the condition passes, a header is added. If not, the `EmptyFilter` is applied.

`EmptyFilter` is an [Action filter](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#action-filters). Since Action filters are ignored by Razor Pages, the `EmptyFilter` has no effect as intended if the path doesn't contain `OtherPages/Page2`.

Request the sample's Page2 page at `localhost:5000/OtherPages/Page2` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![The OtherPagesPage2Header is added to the response for Page2.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/page2-filter-header.png)

**Configure a filter factory**

<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.PageConventionCollectionExtensions.ConfigureFilter*> configures the specified factory to apply [filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters) to all Razor Pages.

The sample app provides an example of using a [filter factory](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#ifilterfactory) by adding a header, `FilterFactoryHeader`, with two values to the app's pages:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet9)]

`AddHeaderWithFactory.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-conventions/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Factories/AddHeaderWithFactory.cs?name=snippet1)]

Request the sample's About page at `localhost:5000/About` and inspect the headers to view the result:

![Response headers of the About page show that two FilterFactoryHeader headers have been added.](razor-pages-conventions/_static/about-page-filter-factory-header.png)

## MVC Filters and the Page filter (IPageFilter)

MVC [Action filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#action-filters) are ignored by Razor Pages, since Razor Pages use handler methods. Other types of MVC filters are available for you to use: [Authorization](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#authorization-filters), [Exception](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#exception-filters), [Resource](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#resource-filters), and [Result](xref:mvc/controllers/filters#result-filters). For more information, see the [Filters](xref:mvc/controllers/filters) topic.

The Page filter (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.IPageFilter>) is a filter that applies to Razor Pages. For more information, see [Filter methods for Razor Pages](xref:razor-pages/filter).
