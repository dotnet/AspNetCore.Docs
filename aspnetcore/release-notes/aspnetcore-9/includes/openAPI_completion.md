### Completion enhancements and package install recommendations for OpenAPI package

ASP.NET Core's OpenAPI support ships in an independent package outside of the shared framework. This means that it's difficult for users to discover built-in OpenAPI API's with code-completion aids like Intellisense. In .NET 9 Preview 6, we've shipped a completion provider/codefixer combination to help users discover built-in OpenAPI support.
