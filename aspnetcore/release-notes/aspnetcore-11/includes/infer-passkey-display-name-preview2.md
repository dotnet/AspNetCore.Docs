### Infer passkey display name from authenticator

ASP.NET Core Identity now automatically infers friendly display names for passkeys based on their AAGUID (Authenticator Attestation GUID). Built-in mappings are included for the most commonly used passkey authenticators, including Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain, Windows Hello, 1Password, and Bitwarden.

For known authenticators, the name is automatically assigned without prompting the user. For unknown authenticators, the user is redirected to a rename page. Developers can extend the mappings by adding entries to the `PasskeyAuthenticators.cs` dictionary in their project.
