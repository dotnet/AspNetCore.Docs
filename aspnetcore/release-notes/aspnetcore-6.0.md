# What's new in ASP.NET Core 6.0

This article highlights the most significant changes in ASP.NET Core 6.0 with links to relevant documentation.

## ASP.NET Core MVC and Razor improvements

## Minimal APIs

Minimal APIs are architected to create HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. They are ideal for microservices and apps that want to include only the minimum files, features, and dependencies in ASP.NET Core. See <xref:tutorials/min-web-api> for more information.

## Blazor

### Blazor WebAssembly native dependencies support

Blazor WebAssembly apps can use native dependencies built to run on WebAssembly. For more information, see <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-6.0#native-dependencies-support>.

### WebAssembly Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and runtime relinking

Blazor WebAssembly supports ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, where you can compile your .NET code directly into WebAssembly. AOT compilation results in runtime performance improvements at the expense of a larger app size. Relinking the .NET WebAssembly runtime trims unused runtime code and thus improves download speed. For more information, see [Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation](xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-6.0#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation) and [Runtime Relinking](xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-6.0#runtime-relinking).

### Persist prerendering state

Blazor supports persisting state in a prerendered page so that the state doesnâ€™t need to be recreated when the app is fully loaded. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/prerendering-and-integration?view=aspnetcore-6.0&pivots=server#preserve-prerendered-state>.

### Error boundaries

Error boundaries provide a convenient approach for handling exceptions. For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/handle-errors?view=aspnetcore-6.0&pivots=server#error-boundaries>.

### SVG support

The [`<foreignObject>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/foreignObject) element is supported to display arbitrary HTML within an SVG. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0#scalable-vector-graphics-svg-images>.

### Blazor Server support for byte-array transfer in JS Interop

Blazor supports optimized byte array JS interop that avoids encoding and decoding byte arrays into Base64. For more information, see the following resources:

<!--
* <xref:blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-6.0#byte-array-support>
* <xref:blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-dotnet-from-javascript?view=aspnetcore-6.0#byte-array-support>
-->
### SignalR message size

Size limitations on SignalR message size for Blazor Server apps have been removed.

### Query string enhancements

Support for working with query strings is improved. For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-6.0#query-strings>.

### Binding to select multiple

Binding supports multiple option selection with `<input>` elements. For more information, see the following resources:

* <xref:blazor/components/data-binding?view=aspnetcore-6.0#multiple-option-selection-with-input-elements>
* <xref:blazor/forms-validation?view=aspnetcore-6.0#multiple-option-selection-with-the-inputselect-component>

### Head (`<head>`) content control

Razor components can modify the HTML `<head>` element content of a page, including setting the page's title (`<title>` element) and modifying metadata (`<meta>` elements). For more information, see <!-- <xref:blazor/components/control-head-content?view=aspnetcore-6.0>. -->

### Generate Angular and React components

Generate framework-specific JavaScript components from Razor components for web frameworks, such as Angular or React. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0#generate-angular-and-react-components>.

### Render components from JavaScript

Razor components can be dynamically-rendered from JavaScript for existing JavaScript apps. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0#render-razor-components-from-javascript>.

### Custom elements

Experimental support is available for building custom elements, which use standard HTML interfaces. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0#blazor-custom-elements>.

### Infer component generic types from ancestor components

An ancestor component can cascade a type parameter by name to descendants using the new `[CascadingTypeParameter]` attribute. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/templated-components?view=aspnetcore-6.0#infer-generic-types-based-on-ancestor-components>.

### Dynamically rendered components

Use the new built-in `DynamicComponent` component to render components by type. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/dynamiccomponent?view=aspnetcore-6.0>.

### Improved Blazor accessibility

Use the new `FocusOnNavigate` component to set the UI focus to an element based on a CSS selector after navigating from one page to another. For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-6.0#focus-an-element-on-navigation>.

### Custom event argument support

Blazor supports custom event arguments, which enable you to pass arbitrary data to .NET event handlers with custom events. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/event-handling?view=aspnetcore-6.0#custom-event-arguments>.

### Required parameters

Apply the new `[EditorRequired]` attribute to specify a required component parameter. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0#component-parameters>.

### Collocation of JavaScript files with pages, views, and components

Collocate JavaScript (JS) files for pages, views, and Razor components as a convenient way to organize scripts in an app. For more information, see <xref:blazor/javascript-interoperability/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0#load-a-script-from-an-external-javascript-file-js-collocated-with-a-component>.

### JavaScript initializers

JavaScript initializers execute logic before and after a Blazor app loads. For more information, see <xref:blazor/javascript-interoperability/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0# javascript-initializers>.

### Streaming JavaScript interop

Blazor now supports streaming data directly between .NET and JavaScript. For more information, see the following resources:

* [Stream from .NET to JavaScript](xref:blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-6.0#stream-from-net-to-javascript)
* [Stream from JavaScript to .NET](xref:blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-6.0#stream-from-javascript-to-net)

### Generic type constraints

Generic type parameters are now supported. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index?view=aspnetcore-6.0#generic-type-parameter-support>.

### WebAssembly deployment layout

Use a deployment layout to enable Blazor WebAssembly app downloads in restricted security environments. For more information, see <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly-deployment-layout?view=aspnetcore-6.0>.

## SignalR

## Kestrel

See <xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/http3> and the blog entry [HTTP/3 support in .NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/http-3-support-in-dotnet-6/).

### Emit KestrelServerOptions via EventSource event

The [KestrelEventSource](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0-rc.2.21480.10/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Infrastructure/KestrelEventSource.cs) emits a new event containing the JSON-serialized <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.KestrelServerOptions> when enabled with verbosity `EventLevel.LogAlways`. This event makes it easier to reason about the server behavior when analyzing collected traces. The following JSON is an example of the event payload:

```json
{
  "AllowSynchronousIO": false,
  "AddServerHeader": true,
  "AllowAlternateSchemes": false,
  "AllowResponseHeaderCompression": true,
  "EnableAltSvc": false,
  "IsDevCertLoaded": true,
  "RequestHeaderEncodingSelector": "default",
  "ResponseHeaderEncodingSelector": "default",
  "Limits": {
    "KeepAliveTimeout": "00:02:10",
    "MaxConcurrentConnections": null,
    "MaxConcurrentUpgradedConnections": null,
    "MaxRequestBodySize": 30000000,
    "MaxRequestBufferSize": 1048576,
    "MaxRequestHeaderCount": 100,
    "MaxRequestHeadersTotalSize": 32768,
    "MaxRequestLineSize": 8192,
    "MaxResponseBufferSize": 65536,
    "MinRequestBodyDataRate": "Bytes per second: 240, Grace Period: 00:00:05",
    "MinResponseDataRate": "Bytes per second: 240, Grace Period: 00:00:05",
    "RequestHeadersTimeout": "00:00:30",
    "Http2": {
      "MaxStreamsPerConnection": 100,
      "HeaderTableSize": 4096,
      "MaxFrameSize": 16384,
      "MaxRequestHeaderFieldSize": 16384,
      "InitialConnectionWindowSize": 131072,
      "InitialStreamWindowSize": 98304,
      "KeepAlivePingDelay": "10675199.02:48:05.4775807",
      "KeepAlivePingTimeout": "00:00:20"
    },
    "Http3": {
      "HeaderTableSize": 0,
      "MaxRequestHeaderFieldSize": 16384
    }
  },
  "ListenOptions": [
    {
      "Address": "https://127.0.0.1:7030",
      "IsTls": true,
      "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2"
    },
    {
      "Address": "https://[::1]:7030",
      "IsTls": true,
      "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2"
    },
    {
      "Address": "http://127.0.0.1:5030",
      "IsTls": false,
      "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2"
    },
    {
      "Address": "http://[::1]:5030",
      "IsTls": false,
      "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### New DiagnosticSource event for rejected HTTP requests

Kestrel now emits a new `DiagnosticSource` event for HTTP requests rejected at the server layer. Prior to this change, there was no way to observe these rejected requests. The new `DiagnosticSource` event `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.BadRequest` contains a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.IBadRequestExceptionFeature> that can be used to introspect the reason for rejecting the request.

[!code-csharp[](aspnetcore-6.0/samples/WebApp1/Program.cs?name=snippet_diag)]

For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/diagnostics>.

### Create a ConnectionContext from an Accept Socket

The new <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketConnectionContextFactory> makes it possible to create a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections.ConnectionContext> from an accepted socket. This makes it possible to build a custom socket-based <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections.IConnectionListenerFactory> without losing out on all the performance work and pooling happening in [SocketConnection](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v6.0.0-rc.2.21480.10/src/Servers/Kestrel/Transport.Sockets/src/Internal/SocketConnection.cs).

See [this example of a custom IConnectionListenerFactory](https://github.com/davidfowl/TcpProxy/blob/main/Backend/DelegatedConnectionListenerFactory.cs) which shows how to use this `SocketConnectionContextFactory`.

## Authentication and authorization

### Authentication servers

.NET 3 to .NET 5 used [IdentityServer4](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/latest/) as part of our template to support the issuing of JWT tokens for SPA and Blazor applications. The templates now use the [Duende Identity Server](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v5).

If you are extending the identity models and are updating existing projects you will need to update the namespaces in your code from `IdentityServer4.IdentityServer` to `Duende.IdentityServer` and follow their [migration instructions](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v5/upgrades/).

The license model for Duende Identity Server has changed to a reciprocal license, which may require license fees when it's used commercially in production. See the [Duende license page](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) for more details.

## API improvements

## Miscellaneous

### Hot reload

Quickly make UI and code updates to running apps without losing app state for faster and more productive developer experience using [Hot reload](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-hot-reload/). For more information, see [Update on .NET Hot Reload progress and Visual Studio 2022 Highlights](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/update-on-net-hot-reload-progress-and-visual-studio-2022-highlights/).

<!-- Notes:
### Single-file publishing
Moved to .NET 7 https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27888#event-5487147790
-->

### Single-page app (SPA) support
<!-- TODO @LadyNaggaga to provide this section-->

### Draft HTTP/3 support in .NET 6

[HTTP/3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-34) is currently in draft and therefore subject to change. HTTP/3 support in ASP.NET Core is not released, it's a preview feature included in .NET 6.

See the blog entry [HTTP/3 support in .NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/http-3-support-in-dotnet-6/).

### Nullable Reference Type Annotations

Portions of the [ASP.NET Core 6.0 source code](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/v6.0.0-rc.2.21480.10/src) has had [nullability annotations](/dotnet/csharp/nullable-migration-strategies) applied.

By utilizing the new Nullable feature in C# 8, ASP.NET Core can provide additional compile-time safety in the handling of reference types. For example, protecting against `null` reference exceptions. Projects that have opted in to using nullable annotations may see new build-time warnings from ASP.NET Core APIs.

To enable nullable reference types, add the following property to project files:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
</PropertyGroup>
```

 For more information, see [Nullable reference types](/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references).

### Source Code Analysis

Several .NET compiler platform analyzers were added that inspect application code for problems such as incorrect middleware configuration or order, routing conflicts, etc. For more information, see <xref:diagnostics/code-analysis>.

### Web app template improvements

The web app templates:

* Use the new [minimal hosting model](xref:migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model).
* Significantly reduces the number of files and lines of code required to create an app. Only one file is needed with four lines of code.
* Unifies `Startup.cs` and `Program.cs` into a single `Program.cs` file.
* Uses [top-level statements](/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements) to minimize the code required for an app.
* Uses [global `using` directives](/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10#global-using-directives) to eliminate or minimize the number of [`using` statement](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement) lines required.

### Template generated ports

Random ports are assigned during project creation for use by the Kestrel web server. Random ports help minimize a port conflict when multiple projects are run on the same machine.

When a project is created, a random HTTP port between 5000-5300 and a random HTTPS port between 7000-7300 is specified in the generated *Properties/launchSettings.json* file. The ports can be changed in the *Properties/launchSettings.json* file. If no port is specified, Kestrel  defaults to the HTTP 5000 and HTTPS 5001 ports. For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints>.

### New logging defaults

The following changes were made to both `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`:

```diff
- "Microsoft": "Warning",
- "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
+ "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
```

The change from `"Microsoft": "Warning"` to `"Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"` results in logging all informational messages from the `Microsoft` namespace ***except*** `Microsoft.AspNetCore`. For example, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` is now logged at the informational level.

### Developer exception page Middleware added automatically

In the [develoment environment](xref:fundamentals/environments), the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware> is added by default. It's no longer necessary to add the following code to web UI apps:

```csharp
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}
```

### Support for Latin1 encoded request headers in HttpSysServer

`HttpSysServer` now supports decoding request headers that are `Latin1` encoded by setting the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys.HttpSysOptions.UseLatin1RequestHeaders> property on <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys.HttpSysOptions> to `true`:

[!code-csharp[](aspnetcore-6.0/samples/WebApp1/Program.cs?name=snippet_latin)]

### The ASP.NET Core Module logs include timestamps and PID

The <xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module> (ANCM) enhanced diagnostic logs include timestamps and [PID](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier) of the process emitting the logs. Logging timestamps and PID makes it easier to diagnose issues with overlapping process restarts in IIS when multiple IIS worker processes are running.

The resulting logs now resemble the sample output show below:

```dotnetcli
[2021-07-28T19:23:44.076Z, PID: 11020] [aspnetcorev2.dll] Initializing logs for 'C:\<path>\aspnetcorev2.dll'. Process Id: 11020. File Version: 16.0.21209.0. Description: IIS ASP.NET Core Module V2. Commit: 96475a2acdf50d7599ba8e96583fa73efbe27912.
