## Authentication and authorization

### Authentication and authorization metrics

Metrics have been added for certain authentication and authorization events in ASP.NET Core. With this change, you can now obtain metrics for the following events:

* Authentication:
  * Authenticated request duration
  * Challenge count
  * Forbid count
  * Sign in count
  * Sign out count
* Authorization:
  * Count of requests requiring authorization

The following image shows an example of the Authenticated request duration metric in the Aspire dashboard:

### Detect if URL is local using `RedirectHttpResult.IsLocalUrl`

Use the new [`RedirectHttpResult.IsLocalUrl(url)`](https://source.dot.net/#Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Results/RedirectHttpResult.cs,c0ece2e6266cb369) helper method to detect if a URL is local. A URL is considered local if the following are true:

* It doesn't have the [host](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL/host) or [authority](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/URI/Authority) section.
* It has an [absolute path](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL#absolute_urls_vs._relative_urls).

URLs using [virtual paths](/previous-versions/aspnet/ms178116(v=vs.100)) `"~/"` are also local.

`IsLocalUrl` is useful for validating URLs before redirecting to them to prevent [open redirection attacks](https://brightsec.com/blog/open-redirect-vulnerabilities/).

```csharp
if (RedirectHttpResult.IsLocalUrl(url))
{
    return Results.LocalRedirect(url);
}
```
