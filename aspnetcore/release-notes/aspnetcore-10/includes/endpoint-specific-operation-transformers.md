### Endpoint-specific OpenAPI operation transformers

Endpoint-specific operation transformers enable fine-grained customization of OpenAPI documentation for individual route endpoints. This feature allows developers to tailor Swagger/OpenAPI metadata and descriptions on a per-action or per-route basis, enhancing extensibility for advanced API scenarios.
