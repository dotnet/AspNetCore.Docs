### Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi added to the ASP.NET Core web API (Native AOT) template

The **ASP.NET Core Web API (Native AOT)** project template (short name `webapiaot`) now includes support for OpenAPI document generation using the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi) package by default. This support is disabled by using the `--no-openapi` flag when creating a new project.
