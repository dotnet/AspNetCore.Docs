### QuickGrid `RowClass` parameter

Apply a stylesheet class to a row of the grid based on the row item using the new `RowClass` parameter. In the following example, the `GetRowCssClass` method is called on each row to conditionally apply a stylesheet class based on the row item:

```razor
<QuickGrid ... RowClass="GetRowCssClass">
    ...
</QuickGrid>

@code {
    private string GetRowCssClass(MyGridItem item) =>
        item.IsArchived ? "row-archived" : null;
}
```

### Blazor script

In prior releases of .NET, the Blazor script is served from an embedded resource in the ASP.NET Core shared framework. In .NET 10 or later, the Blazor script is served as a static web asset with automatic compression and fingerprinting.

For more information, see the following resources:

* <xref:blazor/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-10.0>

### Route template highlights

The [`[Route]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RouteAttribute) now supports route syntax highlighting to help visualize the structure of the route template:

### `NavigateTo` no longer scrolls to the top for same-page navigations

Previously, <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.NavigationManager.NavigateTo%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> scrolled to the top of the page for same-page navigations. This behavior has been changed in .NET 10 so that the browser no longer scrolls to the top of the page when navigating to the same page. This means the viewport is no longer reset when making updates to the address for the current page, such as changing the query string or fragment.

### Reconnection UI component added to the Blazor Web App template

The Blazor Web App project template now includes a `ReconnectModal` component, including collocated stylesheet and JavaScript files, for improved developer control over the reconnection UI when the client loses the WebSocket connection to the server. The component isn't required to inline styles programatically, so it doesn't violate stricter Content Security Policy (CSP) settings for the `style-src` policy, thus avoiding CSP violations that faced the reconnection UI in prior releases.

New reconnection UI features:

* Apart from indicating the reconnection state by setting a specific CSS class on the element with the `components-reconnect-modal` ID, it also dispatches a custom event in `components-reconnect-state-changed` that can be listened for on the modal element.
* The new reconnection state `retrying` is indicated by both a CSS class and the custom event, so that code can better differentiate the stages of the reconnection process.
