### QuickGrid `RowClass` parameter

Apply a stylesheet class to a row of the grid based on the row item using the new `RowClass` parameter. In the following example, the `GetRowCssClass` method is called on each row to conditionally apply a stylesheet class based on the row item:

```razor
<QuickGrid ... RowClass="GetRowCssClass">
    ...
</QuickGrid>

@code {
    private string GetRowCssClass(MyGridItem item) =>
        item.IsArchived ? "row-archived" : null;
}
```

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/quickgrid?view=aspnetcore-10.0#style-a-table-row-based-on-the-row-item>.

### Blazor script as static web asset

In prior releases of .NET, the Blazor script is served from an embedded resource in the ASP.NET Core shared framework. In .NET 10 or later, the Blazor script is served as a static web asset with automatic compression and fingerprinting.

For more information, see the following resources:
  
* <xref:blazor/project-structure?view=aspnetcore-10.0#location-of-the-blazor-script>
* <xref:blazor/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-10.0>

### Route template highlights

The [`[Route]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RouteAttribute) now supports route syntax highlighting to help visualize the structure of the route template:

![Route template pattern of a route attribute for the counter value shows syntax highlighting](~/release-notes/aspnetcore-10/_static/route-template-highlighting.png)

### `NavigateTo` no longer scrolls to the top for same-page navigations

Previously, <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.NavigationManager.NavigateTo%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> scrolled to the top of the page for same-page navigations. This behavior has been changed in .NET 10 so that the browser no longer scrolls to the top of the page when navigating to the same page. This means the viewport is no longer reset when making updates to the address for the current page, such as changing the query string or fragment.

### Reconnection UI component added to the Blazor Web App project template

The Blazor Web App project template now includes a `ReconnectModal` component, including collocated stylesheet and JavaScript files, for improved developer control over the reconnection UI when the client loses the WebSocket connection to the server. The component doesn't insert styles programmatically, ensuring compliance with stricter Content Security Policy (CSP) settings for the `style-src` policy. In prior releases, the default reconnection UI was created by the framework in a way that could cause CSP violations. Note that the default reconnection UI is still used as fallback when the app doesn't define the reconnection UI, such as by using the project template's `ReconnectModal` component or a similar custom component.

New reconnection UI features:

* Apart from indicating the reconnection state by setting a specific CSS class on the reconnection UI element, the new `components-reconnect-state-changed` event is dispatched for reconnection state changes.
* Code can better differentiate the stages of the reconnection process with the new reconnection state "`retrying`," indicated by both the CSS class and the new event.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/signalr?view=aspnetcore-10.0#reflect-the-server-side-connection-state-in-the-ui>.

### Ignore the query string and fragment when using `NavLinkMatch.All`

The `NavLink` component now ignores the query string and fragment when using the `NavLinkMatch.All` value for the `Match` parameter. This means that the link retains the `active` class if the URL path matches but the query string or fragment change. To revert to the original behavior, use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing.NavLink.DisableMatchAllIgnoresLeftUriPart` [`AppContext` switch](/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-appcontext).

You can also override the `ShouldMatch` method on `NavLink` to customize the matching behavior:

```csharp
public class CustomNavLink : NavLink
{
    protected override bool ShouldMatch(string currentUriAbsolute)
    {
        // Custom matching logic
    }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:blazor/fundamentals/routing#navlink-component>.

### Close `QuickGrid` column options

You can now close the `QuickGrid` column options UI using the new `CloseColumnOptionsAsync` method.

The following example uses the `CloseColumnOptionsAsync` method to close the column options UI as soon as the title filter is applied:

```razor
<QuickGrid @ref="movieGrid" Items="movies">
    <PropertyColumn Property="@(m => m.Title)" Title="Title">
        <ColumnOptions>
            <input type="search" @bind="titleFilter" placeholder="Filter by title" 
                @bind:after="@(() => movieGrid.CloseColumnOptionsAsync())" />
        </ColumnOptions>
    </PropertyColumn>
    <PropertyColumn Property="@(m => m.Genre)" Title="Genre" />
    <PropertyColumn Property="@(m => m.ReleaseYear)" Title="Release Year" />
</QuickGrid>

@code {
    private QuickGrid<Movie>? movieGrid;
    private string titleFilter = string.Empty;
    private IQueryable<Movie> movies = new List<Movie> { ... }.AsQueryable();
    private IQueryable<Movie> filteredMovies => 
        movies.Where(m => m.Title!.Contains(titleFilter));
}
```

<!-- PREVIEW 3 ..... NOTE CONTENT CHANGE FOR `<WasmEnableStreamingResponse>` BELOW!!!!!

### Response streaming is opt-in and how to opt-out

In prior Blazor releases, response streaming for <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> requests was opt-in. Now, response streaming is enabled by default.

This is a breaking change because calling <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpContent.ReadAsStreamAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> for an <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage.Content%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> (`response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync()`) returns a `BrowserHttpReadStream` and no longer a <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream>. `BrowserHttpReadStream` doesn't support synchronous operations, such as `Stream.Read(Span<Byte>)`. If your code uses synchronous operations, you can opt-out of response streaming or copy the <xref:System.IO.Stream> into a <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> yourself.

DON'T USE (comment out) ..............

To opt-out of response streaming globally, use either of the following approaches:

* Add the `<WasmEnableStreamingResponse>` property to the project file with a value of `false`:
  
  ```xml
  <WasmEnableStreamingResponse>false</WasmEnableStreamingResponse>
  ```

* Set the `DOTNET_WASM_ENABLE_STREAMING_RESPONSE` environment variable to `false` or `0`.

..................... UNTIL https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/97449 IS RESOLVED AND RELEASED.

To opt-out of response streaming globally, set the `DOTNET_WASM_ENABLE_STREAMING_RESPONSE` environment variable to `false` or `0`.

To opt-out of response streaming for an individual request, set <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserResponseStreamingEnabled%2A> to `false` on the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage> (`requestMessage` in the following example):

```csharp
requestMessage.SetBrowserResponseStreamingEnabled(false);
```

For more information, see [`HttpClient` and `HttpRequestMessage` with Fetch API request options (*Call web API* article)](xref:blazor/call-web-api?view=aspnetcore-10.0#httpclient-and-httprequestmessage-with-fetch-api-request-options).

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX CHANGE EARLIER COVERAGE XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

In the "Ignore the query string and fragment when using `NavLinkMatch.All`" section, change 
`DisableMatchAllIgnoresLeftUriPart` to `EnableMatchAllForQueryStringAndFragmentSwitchKey` 
set to `true`.

Also make this change in the *Routing* article at Line 1633.

### Client-side fingerprinting

Last year, the release of .NET 9 introduced [server-side fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)) of static assets in Blazor Web Apps with the introduction of [Map Static Assets routing endpoint conventions (`MapStaticAssets`)](xref:fundamentals/map-static-files), the [`ImportMap` component](xref:blazor/fundamentals/static-files#importmap-component), and the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase.Assets?displayProperty=nameWithType> property (`@Assets["..."]`) to resolve fingerprinted JavaScript modules. For .NET 10, you can opt-into client-side fingerprinting of JavaScript modules for standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps.

In standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps during build/publish, the framework overrides placeholders in `index.html` with values computed during build to fingerprint static assets. A fingerprint is placed into the `blazor.webassembly.js` script file name.

The following changes must be made in the `wwwwoot/index.html` file to adopt the fingerprinting feature. The standalone Blazor WebAssembly project template will be updated to include these changes in an upcoming preview release:

```diff
<head>
    ...
+   <script type="importmap"></script>
</head>

<body>
    ...
-   <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
+   <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly#[.{fingerprint}].js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

In the project file (`.csproj`), add the `<WriteImportMapToHtml>` property set to `true`:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
+   <WriteImportMapToHtml>true</WriteImportMapToHtml>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

To fingerprint additional JS modules in standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps, use the `<StaticWebAssetFingerprintPattern>` property in the app's project file (`.csproj`).

In the following example, a fingerprint is added for all developer-supplied `.mjs` files in the app:

```xml
<StaticWebAssetFingerprintPattern Include="JSModule" Pattern="*.mjs" 
  Expression="#[.{fingerprint}]!" />
```

The files are automatically placed into the import map:

* Automatically for Blazor Web App CSR.
* When opting-into module fingerprinting in standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps per the preceding instructions.

When resolving the import for JavaScript interop, the import map is used by the browser resolve fingerprinted files.

### Set the environment in standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps

The `Properties/launchSettings.json` file is no longer used to control the environment in standalone Blazor WebAssembly apps.

Starting in .NET 10, set the environment with the `<WasmApplicationEnvironmentName>` property in the app's project file (`.csproj`).

The following example sets the app's environment to `Staging`:

```xml
<WasmApplicationEnvironmentName>Staging</WasmApplicationEnvironmentName>
```

The default environments are:

* `Development` for build.
* `Production` for publish.

## Boot configuration file name change

The boot configuration file is changing names from `blazor.boot.json` to `dotnet.boot.js`. This name change only affects developers who are interacting directly with the file, such as when developers are:

* Checking file integrity for published assets with the troubleshoot integrity PowerShell script per the guidance in <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly/bundle-caching-and-integrity-check-failures?view=aspnetcore-9.0#troubleshoot-integrity-powershell-script>.
* Changing the file name extension of DLL files when not using the default Webcil file format per the guidance in <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly/index?view=aspnetcore-9.0#customize-how-boot-resources-are-loaded>.
