# View-based authorization in ASP.NET Core MVC

A developer often wants to show, hide, or otherwise modify a UI based on the current user identity. You can access the authorization service within MVC views via [dependency injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection). To inject the authorization service into a Razor view, use the `@inject` directive:

```cshtml
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
@inject IAuthorizationService AuthorizationService
```

If you want the authorization service in every view, place the `@inject` directive into the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file of the *Views* directory. For more information, see [Dependency injection into views](xref:mvc/views/dependency-injection).

Use the injected authorization service to invoke `AuthorizeAsync` in exactly the same way you would check during [resource-based authorization](xref:security/authorization/resourcebased#security-authorization-resource-based-imperative):

```cshtml
@if ((await AuthorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(User, "PolicyName")).Succeeded)
{
    <p>This paragraph is displayed because you fulfilled PolicyName.</p>
}
```

In some cases, the resource will be your view model. Invoke `AuthorizeAsync` in exactly the same way you would check during [resource-based authorization](xref:security/authorization/resourcebased#security-authorization-resource-based-imperative):

```cshtml
@if ((await AuthorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(User, Model, Operations.Edit)).Succeeded)
{
    <p><a class="btn btn-default" role="button"
        href="@Url.Action("Edit", "Document", new { id = Model.Id })">Edit</a></p>
}
```

In the preceding code, the model is passed as a resource the policy evaluation should take into consideration.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't rely on toggling visibility of your app's UI elements as the sole authorization check. Hiding a UI element may not completely prevent access to its associated controller action. For example, consider the button in the preceding code snippet. A user can invoke the `Edit` action method if he or she knows the relative resource URL is */Document/Edit/1*. For this reason, the `Edit` action method should perform its own authorization check.
