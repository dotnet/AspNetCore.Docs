# Configure certificate authentication in ASP.NET Core

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate` contains an implementation similar to [Certificate Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.4) for ASP.NET Core. Certificate authentication happens at the TLS level, long before it ever gets to ASP.NET Core. More accurately, this is an authentication handler that validates the certificate and then gives you an event where you can resolve that certificate to a `ClaimsPrincipal`. 

You ***must*** [configure your server](#configure-your-server-to-require-certificates) for certificate authentication, be it IIS, Kestrel, Azure Web Apps, or whatever else you're using.

## Proxy and load balancer scenarios

Certificate authentication is a stateful scenario primarily used where a proxy or load balancer doesn't handle traffic between clients and servers. If a proxy or load balancer is used, certificate authentication only works if the proxy or load balancer:

* Handles the authentication.
* Passes the user authentication information to the app (for example, in a request header), which acts on the authentication information.

An alternative to certificate authentication in environments where proxies and load balancers are used is Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) with OpenID Connect (OIDC).

## Get started

Acquire an HTTPS certificate, apply it, and [configure your server](#configure-your-server-to-require-certificates) to require certificates.

In the web app:

* Add a reference to the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate) NuGet package.
* In `Program.cs`, call
`builder.Services.AddAuthentication(CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddCertificate(...);`. Provide a delegate for `OnCertificateValidated` to do any supplementary validation on the client certificate sent with requests. Turn that information into a `ClaimsPrincipal` and set it on the `context.Principal` property.

If authentication fails, this handler returns a `403 (Forbidden)` response rather a `401 (Unauthorized)`, as you might expect. The reasoning is that the authentication should happen during the initial TLS connection. By the time it reaches the handler, it's too late. There's no way to upgrade the connection from an anonymous connection to one with a certificate.

`UseAuthentication` is required to set `HttpContext.User` to a `ClaimsPrincipal` created from the certificate. For example:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_AddCertificateUseAuthentication" highlight="3-5,9":::

The preceding example demonstrates the default way to add certificate authentication. The handler constructs a user principal using the common certificate properties.

## Configure certificate validation

The `CertificateAuthenticationOptions` handler has some built-in validations that are the minimum validations you should perform on a certificate. Each of these settings is enabled by default.

### AllowedCertificateTypes = Chained, SelfSigned, or All (Chained | SelfSigned)

Default value: `CertificateTypes.Chained`

This check validates that only the appropriate certificate type is allowed. If the app is using self-signed certificates, this option needs to be set to `CertificateTypes.All` or `CertificateTypes.SelfSigned`.

### ValidateCertificateUse

Default value: `true`

This check validates that the certificate presented by the client has the Client Authentication extended key use (EKU), or no EKUs at all. As the specifications say, if no EKU is specified, then all EKUs are deemed valid.

### ValidateValidityPeriod

Default value: `true`

This check validates that the certificate is within its validity period. On each request, the handler ensures that a certificate that was valid when it was presented hasn't expired during its current session.

### RevocationFlag

Default value: `X509RevocationFlag.ExcludeRoot`

A flag that specifies which certificates in the chain are checked for revocation.

Revocation checks are only performed when the certificate is chained to a root certificate.

### RevocationMode

Default value: `X509RevocationMode.Online`

A flag that specifies how revocation checks are performed.

Specifying an online check can result in a long delay while the certificate authority is contacted.

Revocation checks are only performed when the certificate is chained to a root certificate.

### Can I configure my app to require a certificate only on certain paths?

This isn't possible. Remember the certificate exchange is done at the start of the HTTPS conversation, it's done by the server before the first request is received on that connection so it's not possible to scope based on any request fields.

## Handler events

The handler has two events:

* `OnAuthenticationFailed`: Called if an exception happens during authentication and allows you to react.
* `OnCertificateValidated`: Called after the certificate has been validated, passed validation and a default principal has been created. This event allows you to perform your own validation and augment or replace the principal. For examples include:
  * Determining if the certificate is known to your services.
  * Constructing your own principal. Consider the following example:

    :::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_AddCertificateOnCertificateValidated":::

If you find the inbound certificate doesn't meet your extra validation, call `context.Fail("failure reason")` with a failure reason.

For better functionality, call a service registered in dependency injection that connects to a database or other type of user store. Access the service by using the context passed into the delegate. Consider the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_AddCertificateOnCertificateValidatedService" highlight="9-10,12":::

Conceptually, the validation of the certificate is an authorization concern. Adding a check on, for example, an issuer or thumbprint in an authorization policy, rather than inside `OnCertificateValidated`, is perfectly acceptable.

## Configure your server to require certificates

### Kestrel

In `Program.cs`, configure Kestrel as follows:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Program.cs" id="snippet_ConfigureKestrelServerOptions":::

> [!NOTE]
> Endpoints created by calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerOptions.Listen%2A> **before** calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerOptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults%2A> won't have the defaults applied.

### IIS

Complete the following steps in IIS Manager:

1. Select your site from the **Connections** tab.
1. Double-click the **SSL Settings** option in the **Features View** window.
1. Check the **Require SSL** checkbox, and select the **Require** radio button in the **Client certificates** section.

:::image source="certauth/_static/README-IISConfig.png" alt-text="Client certificate settings in IIS":::

### Azure and custom web proxies

See the [host and deploy documentation](xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer#certificate-forwarding) for how to configure the certificate forwarding middleware.

### Use certificate authentication in Azure Web Apps

No forwarding configuration is required for Azure. Forwarding configuration is set up by the Certificate Forwarding Middleware.

> [!NOTE]
> Certificate Forwarding Middleware is required for this scenario.

For more information, see [Use a TLS/SSL certificate in your code in Azure App Service (Azure documentation)](/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate-in-code).

### Use certificate authentication in custom web proxies

The `AddCertificateForwarding` method is used to specify:

* The client header name.
* How the certificate is to be loaded (using the `HeaderConverter` property).

In custom web proxies, the certificate is passed as a custom request header, for example `X-SSL-CERT`. To use it, configure certificate forwarding in `Program.cs`:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_AddCertificateForwarding":::

If the app is reverse proxied by NGINX with the configuration `proxy_set_header ssl-client-cert $ssl_client_escaped_cert` or deployed on Kubernetes using NGINX Ingress, the client certificate is passed to the app in [URL-encoded form](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding). To use the certificate, decode it as follows:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_AddCertificateForwardingUrlEncoded":::

Add the middleware in `Program.cs`. `UseCertificateForwarding` is called before the calls to `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization`:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_UseCertificateForwarding" highlight="3":::

A separate class can be used to implement validation logic. Because the same self-signed certificate is used in this example, ensure that only your certificate can be used. Validate that the thumbprints of both the client certificate and the server certificate match, otherwise any certificate can be used and will be enough to authenticate. This would be used inside the `AddCertificate` method. You could also validate the subject or the issuer here if you're using intermediate or child certificates.

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/SampleCertificateValidationService.cs":::

#### Implement an HttpClient using a certificate and IHttpClientFactory

In the following example, a client certificate is added to a `HttpClientHandler` using the `ClientCertificates` property from the handler. This handler can then be used in a named instance of an `HttpClient` using the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HttpClientBuilderExtensions.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler%2A> method. This is setup in `Program.cs`:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_AddHttpClient":::

The `IHttpClientFactory` can then be used to get the named instance with the handler and the certificate. The `CreateClient` method with the name of the client defined in `Program.cs` is used to get the instance. The HTTP request can be sent using the client as required:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/SampleHttpService.cs" id="snippet_Class":::

If the correct certificate is sent to the server, the data is returned. If no certificate or the wrong certificate is sent, an HTTP 403 status code is returned.

### Create certificates in PowerShell

Creating the certificates is the hardest part in setting up this flow. A root certificate can be created using the `New-SelfSignedCertificate` PowerShell cmdlet. When creating the certificate, use a strong password. It's important to add the `KeyUsageProperty` parameter and the `KeyUsage` parameter as shown.

#### Create root CA

```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com", "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\root_ca_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath root_ca_dev_damienbod.crt
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-DnsName` parameter value must match the deployment target of the app. For example, "localhost" for development.

#### Install in the trusted root

The root certificate needs to be trusted on your host system. A root certificate which was not created by a certificate authority won't be trusted by default. For information on how to trust the root certificate on Windows, see [this question](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/SqlServer/5ed119ef-1704-4be4-8a4f-ef11de7c8f34/a-certificate-chain-processed-but-terminated-in-a-root-certificate-which-is-not-trusted-by-the).

#### Intermediate certificate

An intermediate certificate can now be created from the root certificate. This isn't required for all use cases, but you might need to create many certificates or need to activate or disable groups of certificates. The `TextExtension` parameter is required to set the path length in the basic constraints of the certificate.

The intermediate certificate can then be added to the trusted intermediate certificate in the Windows host system.

```powershell
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

$parentcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\"The thumbprint of the root..." )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "intermediate_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $parentcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "intermediate_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature -TextExtension @("2.5.29.19={text}CA=1&pathlength=1")

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\intermediate_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath intermediate_dev_damienbod.crt
```

#### Create child certificate from intermediate certificate

A child certificate can be created from the intermediate certificate. This is the end entity and doesn't need to create more child certificates.

```powershell
$parentcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\"The thumbprint from the Intermediate certificate..." )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "child_a_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $parentcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "child_a_dev_damienbod.com"

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\child_a_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath child_a_dev_damienbod.crt
```

#### Create child certificate from root certificate

A child certificate can also be created from the root certificate directly. 

```powershell
$rootcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\"The thumbprint from the root cert..." )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "child_a_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $rootcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "child_a_dev_damienbod.com"

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\child_a_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath child_a_dev_damienbod.crt
```

#### Example root - intermediate certificate - certificate

```powershell
$mypwdroot = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com", "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\0C89639E4E2998A93E423F919B36D4009A0F9991 | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\root_ca_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwdroot

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\0C89639E4E2998A93E423F919B36D4009A0F9991 -FilePath root_ca_dev_damienbod.crt

$rootcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\0C89639E4E2998A93E423F919B36D4009A0F9991 )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "child_a_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $rootcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "child_a_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature -TextExtension @("2.5.29.19={text}CA=1&pathlength=1")

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\BA9BF91ED35538A01375EFC212A2F46104B33A44 | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\child_a_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\BA9BF91ED35538A01375EFC212A2F46104B33A44 -FilePath child_a_dev_damienbod.crt

$parentcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\BA9BF91ED35538A01375EFC212A2F46104B33A44 )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "child_b_from_a_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $parentcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "child_b_from_a_dev_damienbod.com" 

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\141594A0AE38CBBECED7AF680F7945CD51D8F28A | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\child_b_from_a_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\141594A0AE38CBBECED7AF680F7945CD51D8F28A -FilePath child_b_from_a_dev_damienbod.crt
```

When using the root, intermediate, or child certificates, the certificates can be validated using the Thumbprint or PublicKey as required:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/SampleCertificateThumbprintsValidationService.cs":::

<a name="occ"></a>

## Certificate validation caching

ASP.NET Core 5.0 and later versions support the ability to enable caching of validation results. The caching dramatically improves performance of certificate authentication, as validation is an expensive operation.

By default, certificate authentication disables caching. To enable caching, call `AddCertificateCache` in `Program.cs`:

:::code language="csharp" source="certauth/samples/6.x/CertAuthSample/Snippets/Program.cs" id="snippet_AddCertificateCaching":::

The default caching implementation stores results in memory. You can provide your own cache by implementing `ICertificateValidationCache` and registering it with dependency injection. For example, `services.AddSingleton<ICertificateValidationCache, YourCache>()`.

## Optional client certificates

This section provides information for apps that must protect a subset of the app with a certificate. For example, a Razor Page or controller in the app might require client certificates. This presents challenges as client certificates:
  
* Are a TLS feature, not an HTTP feature.
* Are negotiated per-connection and usually at the start of the connection before any HTTP data is available. 

There are two approaches to implementing optional client certificates:
1. Using separate host names (SNI) and redirecting. While more work to configure, this is recommended because it works in most environments and protocols.
2. Renegotiation during an HTTP request. This has several limitations and is not recommended.

### Separate Hosts (SNI)

At the start of the connection, only the Server Name Indication (SNI)&dagger; is known. Client certificates can be configured per host name so that one host requires them and another does not.

* Set up binding for the domain and subdomain:
  * For example, set up bindings on `contoso.com` and `myClient.contoso.com`. The `contoso.com` host doesn't require a client certificate but `myClient.contoso.com` does.
  * For more information, see:
    * <xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel>:
      * [ListenOptions.UseHttps](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints#listenoptionsusehttps)
      * <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions.ClientCertificateMode>
    * IIS
      * [Hosting IIS](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index#create-the-iis-site)
      * [Configure security on IIS](/iis/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis#configure-ssl-settings-2)
    * HTTP.sys: [Configure Windows Server](xref:fundamentals/servers/httpsys#configure-windows-server)

ASP.NET Core 5 and later adds more convenient support for redirecting to acquire optional client certificates. For more information, see the [Optional certificates sample](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/9ce4a970a21bace3fb262da9591ed52359309592/src/Security/Authentication/Certificate/samples/Certificate.Optional.Sample).

* For requests to the web app that require a client certificate and don't have one:
  * Redirect to the same page using the client certificate protected subdomain.
  * For example, redirect to `myClient.contoso.com/requestedPage`. Because the request to `myClient.contoso.com/requestedPage` is a different hostname than `contoso.com/requestedPage`, the client establishes a different connection and the client certificate is provided.
  * For more information, see <xref:security/authorization/introduction>.

&dagger; Server Name Indication (SNI) is a TLS extension to include a virtual domain as a part of SSL negotiation. This effectively means the virtual domain name, or a hostname, can be used to identify the network end point.

### Renegotiation

TLS renegotiation is a process by which the client and server can re-assess the encryption requirements for an individual connection, including requesting a client certificate if not previously provided. TLS renegotiation is a security risk and isn't recommended because:

* In HTTP/1.1 the server must first buffer or consume any HTTP data that is in flight such as POST request bodies to make sure the connection is clear for the renegotiation. Otherwise the renegotiation can stop responding or fail.
* HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 [explicitly prohibit](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2.1) renegotiation.
* There are security risks associated with renegotiation. TLS 1.3 removed renegotiation of the whole connection and replaced it with a new extension for requesting only the client certificate after the start of the connection. This mechanism is exposed via the same APIs and is still subject to the prior constraints of buffering and HTTP protocol versions.

The implementation and configuration of this feature varies by server and framework version.

#### IIS

IIS manages the client certificate negotiation on your behalf. A subsection of the application can enable the `SslRequireCert` option to negotiate the client certificate for those requests. See [Configuration in the IIS documentation](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/access#configuration) for details.

IIS will automatically buffer any request body data up to a configured size limit before renegotiating. Requests that exceed the limit are rejected with a 413 response. This limit defaults to 48MB and is configurable by setting the [uploadReadAheadSize](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/serverruntime).

#### HttpSys

HttpSys has two settings which control the client certificate negotiation and both should be set. The first is in netsh.exe under `http add sslcert clientcertnegotiation=enable/disable`. This flag indicates if the client certificate should be negotiated at the start of a connection and it should be set to `disable` for optional client certificates. See the [netsh docs](/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-http#add-sslcert) for details.

The other setting is <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys.HttpSysOptions.ClientCertificateMethod>. When set to `AllowRenegotation`, the client certificate can be renegotiated during a request.

*NOTE* The application should buffer or consume any request body data before attempting the renegotiation, otherwise the request may become unresponsive.

An application can first check the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.ClientCertificate> property to see if the certificate is available. If it is not available, ensure the request body has been consumed before calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.GetClientCertificateAsync%2A> to negotiate one. Note `GetClientCertificateAsync` can return a null certificate if the client declines to provide one.

*NOTE* The behavior of the `ClientCertificate` property changed in .NET 6. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/466).

#### Kestrel

Kestrel controls client certificate negotation with the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions.ClientCertificateMode> option.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.ClientCertificateMode.DelayCertificate?displayProperty=nameWithType> is new option available in .NET 6 or later. When set, an app can check the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.ClientCertificate> property to see if the certificate is available. If it isn't available, ensure the request body has been consumed before calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.GetClientCertificateAsync%2A> to negotiate one. Note `GetClientCertificateAsync` can return a null certificate if the client declines to provide one.

*NOTE* The application should buffer or consume any request body data before attempting the renegotiation, otherwise `GetClientCertificateAsync` may throw `InvalidOperationException: Client stream needs to be drained before renegotiation.`.

If you're programmatically configuring the TLS settings per host there is a new [UseHttps](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints#listenoptionsusehttps) overload available in .NET 6 and later that takes <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.TlsHandshakeCallbackOptions> and controls client certificate renegotiation via <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.TlsHandshakeCallbackContext.AllowDelayedClientCertificateNegotation%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate` contains an implementation similar to [Certificate Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.4) for ASP.NET Core. Certificate authentication happens at the TLS level, long before it ever gets to ASP.NET Core. More accurately, this is an authentication handler that validates the certificate and then gives you an event where you can resolve that certificate to a `ClaimsPrincipal`. 

[Configure your server](#configure-your-server-to-require-certificates) for certificate authentication, be it IIS, Kestrel, Azure Web Apps, or whatever else you're using.

## Proxy and load balancer scenarios

Certificate authentication is a stateful scenario primarily used where a proxy or load balancer doesn't handle traffic between clients and servers. If a proxy or load balancer is used, certificate authentication only works if the proxy or load balancer:

* Handles the authentication.
* Passes the user authentication information to the app (for example, in a request header), which acts on the authentication information.

An alternative to certificate authentication in environments where proxies and load balancers are used is Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) with OpenID Connect (OIDC).

## Get started

Acquire an HTTPS certificate, apply it, and [configure your server](#configure-your-server-to-require-certificates) to require certificates.

In your web app, add a reference to the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate) package. Then in the `Startup.ConfigureServices` method, call
`services.AddAuthentication(CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddCertificate(...);` with your options, providing a delegate for `OnCertificateValidated` to do any supplementary validation on the client certificate sent with requests. Turn that information into a `ClaimsPrincipal` and set it on the `context.Principal` property.

If authentication fails, this handler returns a `403 (Forbidden)` response rather a `401 (Unauthorized)`, as you might expect. The reasoning is that the authentication should happen during the initial TLS connection. By the time it reaches the handler, it's too late. There's no way to upgrade the connection from an anonymous connection to one with a certificate.

Also add `app.UseAuthentication();` in the `Startup.Configure` method. Otherwise, the `HttpContext.User` will not be set to `ClaimsPrincipal` created from the certificate. For example:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(
        CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddCertificate()
        // Adding an ICertificateValidationCache results in certificate auth caching the results.
        // The default implementation uses a memory cache.
        .AddCertificateCache();

    // All other service configuration
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseAuthentication();

    // All other app configuration
}
```

The preceding example demonstrates the default way to add certificate authentication. The handler constructs a user principal using the common certificate properties.

## Configure certificate validation

The `CertificateAuthenticationOptions` handler has some built-in validations that are the minimum validations you should perform on a certificate. Each of these settings is enabled by default.

### AllowedCertificateTypes = Chained, SelfSigned, or All (Chained | SelfSigned)

Default value: `CertificateTypes.Chained`

This check validates that only the appropriate certificate type is allowed. If the app is using self-signed certificates, this option needs to be set to `CertificateTypes.All` or `CertificateTypes.SelfSigned`.

### ValidateCertificateUse

Default value: `true`

This check validates that the certificate presented by the client has the Client Authentication extended key use (EKU), or no EKUs at all. As the specifications say, if no EKU is specified, then all EKUs are deemed valid.

### ValidateValidityPeriod

Default value: `true`

This check validates that the certificate is within its validity period. On each request, the handler ensures that a certificate that was valid when it was presented hasn't expired during its current session.

### RevocationFlag

Default value: `X509RevocationFlag.ExcludeRoot`

A flag that specifies which certificates in the chain are checked for revocation.

Revocation checks are only performed when the certificate is chained to a root certificate.

### RevocationMode

Default value: `X509RevocationMode.Online`

A flag that specifies how revocation checks are performed.

Specifying an online check can result in a long delay while the certificate authority is contacted.

Revocation checks are only performed when the certificate is chained to a root certificate.

### Can I configure my app to require a certificate only on certain paths?

This isn't possible. Remember the certificate exchange is done at the start of the HTTPS conversation, it's done by the server before the first request is received on that connection so it's not possible to scope based on any request fields.

## Handler events

The handler has two events:

* `OnAuthenticationFailed`: Called if an exception happens during authentication and allows you to react.
* `OnCertificateValidated`: Called after the certificate has been validated, passed validation and a default principal has been created. This event allows you to perform your own validation and augment or replace the principal. For examples include:
  * Determining if the certificate is known to your services.
  * Constructing your own principal. Consider the following example in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication(
        CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddCertificate(options =>
        {
            options.Events = new CertificateAuthenticationEvents
            {
                OnCertificateValidated = context =>
                {
                    var claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim(
                            ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, 
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject,
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer),
                        new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name,
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject,
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer)
                    };
    
                    context.Principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(
                        new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Scheme.Name));
                    context.Success();
    
                    return Task.CompletedTask;
                }
            };
        });
    ```

If you find the inbound certificate doesn't meet your extra validation, call `context.Fail("failure reason")` with a failure reason.

For real functionality, you'll probably want to call a service registered in dependency injection that connects to a database or other type of user store. Access your service by using the context passed into your delegate. Consider the following example in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddAuthentication(
    CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCertificate(options =>
    {
        options.Events = new CertificateAuthenticationEvents
        {
            OnCertificateValidated = context =>
            {
                var validationService =
                    context.HttpContext.RequestServices
                        .GetRequiredService<ICertificateValidationService>();
                
                if (validationService.ValidateCertificate(
                    context.ClientCertificate))
                {
                    var claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim(
                            ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, 
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject, 
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer),
                        new Claim(
                            ClaimTypes.Name, 
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject, 
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer)
                    };

                    context.Principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(
                        new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Scheme.Name));
                    context.Success();
                }                     

                return Task.CompletedTask;
            }
        };
    });
```

Conceptually, the validation of the certificate is an authorization concern. Adding a check on, for example, an issuer or thumbprint in an authorization policy, rather than inside `OnCertificateValidated`, is perfectly acceptable.

## Configure your server to require certificates

### Kestrel

In `Program.cs`, configure Kestrel as follows:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
}

public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args)
{
    return Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            webBuilder.ConfigureKestrel(o =>
            {
                o.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(o => 
                    o.ClientCertificateMode =  ClientCertificateMode.RequireCertificate);
            });
        });
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Endpoints created by calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerOptions.Listen%2A> **before** calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerOptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults%2A> won't have the defaults applied.

### IIS

Complete the following steps in IIS Manager:

1. Select your site from the **Connections** tab.
1. Double-click the **SSL Settings** option in the **Features View** window.
1. Check the **Require SSL** checkbox, and select the **Require** radio button in the **Client certificates** section.

### Azure and custom web proxies

See the [host and deploy documentation](xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer#certificate-forwarding) for how to configure the certificate forwarding middleware.

### Use certificate authentication in Azure Web Apps

No forwarding configuration is required for Azure. Forwarding configuration is set up by the Certificate Forwarding Middleware.

> [!NOTE]
> Certificate Forwarding Middleware is required for this scenario.

For more information, see [Use a TLS/SSL certificate in your code in Azure App Service (Azure documentation)](/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate-in-code).

### Use certificate authentication in custom web proxies

The `AddCertificateForwarding` method is used to specify:

* The client header name.
* How the certificate is to be loaded (using the `HeaderConverter` property).

In custom web proxies, the certificate is passed as a custom request header, for example `X-SSL-CERT`. To use it, configure certificate forwarding in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCertificateForwarding(options =>
    {
        options.CertificateHeader = "X-SSL-CERT";
        options.HeaderConverter = (headerValue) =>
        {
            X509Certificate2 clientCertificate = null;

            if(!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(headerValue))
            {
                byte[] bytes = StringToByteArray(headerValue);
                clientCertificate = new X509Certificate2(bytes);
            }

            return clientCertificate;
        };
    });
}

private static byte[] StringToByteArray(string hex)
{
    int NumberChars = hex.Length;
    byte[] bytes = new byte[NumberChars / 2];

    for (int i = 0; i < NumberChars; i += 2)
    {
        bytes[i / 2] = Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(i, 2), 16);
    }

    return bytes;
}
```

If the app is reverse proxied by NGINX with the configuration `proxy_set_header ssl-client-cert $ssl_client_escaped_cert` or deployed on Kubernetes using NGINX Ingress, the client certificate is passed to the app in [URL-encoded form](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding). To use the certificate, decode it as follows:

In `Startup.ConfigureServices` (`Startup.cs`):

```csharp
services.AddCertificateForwarding(options =>
{
    options.CertificateHeader = "ssl-client-cert";
    options.HeaderConverter = (headerValue) =>
    {
        X509Certificate2 clientCertificate = null;

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(headerValue))
        {
            string certPem = WebUtility.UrlDecode(headerValue);
            clientCertificate = X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem(certPem);
        }

        return clientCertificate;
    };
});
```

The `Startup.Configure` method then adds the middleware. `UseCertificateForwarding` is called before the calls to `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization`:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseCertificateForwarding();
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

A separate class can be used to implement validation logic. Because the same self-signed certificate is used in this example, ensure that only your certificate can be used. Validate that the thumbprints of both the client certificate and the server certificate match, otherwise any certificate can be used and will be enough to authenticate. This would be used inside the `AddCertificate` method. You could also validate the subject or the issuer here if you're using intermediate or child certificates.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

namespace AspNetCoreCertificateAuthApi
{
    public class MyCertificateValidationService
    {
        public bool ValidateCertificate(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
        {
            // Do not hardcode passwords in production code
            // Use thumbprint or key vault
            var cert = new X509Certificate2(
                Path.Combine("sts_dev_cert.pfx"), "1234");

            if (clientCertificate.Thumbprint == cert.Thumbprint)
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Implement an HttpClient using a certificate and the HttpClientHandler

The `HttpClientHandler` could be added directly in the constructor of the `HttpClient` class. Care should be taken when creating instances of the `HttpClient`. The `HttpClient` will then send the certificate with each request.

```csharp
private async Task<JsonDocument> GetApiDataUsingHttpClientHandler()
{
    var cert = new X509Certificate2(Path.Combine(_environment.ContentRootPath, "sts_dev_cert.pfx"), "1234");
    var handler = new HttpClientHandler();
    handler.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);
    var client = new HttpClient(handler);
     
    var request = new HttpRequestMessage()
    {
        RequestUri = new Uri("https://localhost:44379/api/values"),
        Method = HttpMethod.Get,
    };
    var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        var data = JsonDocument.Parse(responseContent);
        return data;
    }
 
    throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
}
```

#### Implement an HttpClient using a certificate and a named HttpClient from IHttpClientFactory 

In the following example, a client certificate is added to a `HttpClientHandler` using the `ClientCertificates` property from the handler. This handler can then be used in a named instance of an `HttpClient` using the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HttpClientBuilderExtensions.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler%2A> method. This is setup in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
var clientCertificate = 
    new X509Certificate2(
      Path.Combine(_environment.ContentRootPath, "sts_dev_cert.pfx"), "1234");

services.AddHttpClient("namedClient", c =>
{
}).ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() =>
{
    var handler = new HttpClientHandler();
    handler.ClientCertificates.Add(clientCertificate);
    return handler;
});
```

The `IHttpClientFactory` can then be used to get the named instance with the handler and the certificate. The `CreateClient` method with the name of the client defined in the `Startup` class is used to get the instance. The HTTP request can be sent using the client as required.

```csharp
private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
 
public ApiService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
{
    _clientFactory = clientFactory;
}
 
private async Task<JsonDocument> GetApiDataWithNamedClient()
{
    var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("namedClient");
 
    var request = new HttpRequestMessage()
    {
        RequestUri = new Uri("https://localhost:44379/api/values"),
        Method = HttpMethod.Get,
    };
    var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        var data = JsonDocument.Parse(responseContent);
        return data;
    }
 
    throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
}
```

If the correct certificate is sent to the server, the data is returned. If no certificate or the wrong certificate is sent, an HTTP 403 status code is returned.

### Create certificates in PowerShell

Creating the certificates is the hardest part in setting up this flow. A root certificate can be created using the `New-SelfSignedCertificate` PowerShell cmdlet. When creating the certificate, use a strong password. It's important to add the `KeyUsageProperty` parameter and the `KeyUsage` parameter as shown.

#### Create root CA

```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com", "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\root_ca_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath root_ca_dev_damienbod.crt
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-DnsName` parameter value must match the deployment target of the app. For example, "localhost" for development.

#### Install in the trusted root

The root certificate needs to be trusted on your host system. A root certificate which was not created by a certificate authority won't be trusted by default. For information on how to trust the root certificate on Windows, see [this question](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/SqlServer/5ed119ef-1704-4be4-8a4f-ef11de7c8f34/a-certificate-chain-processed-but-terminated-in-a-root-certificate-which-is-not-trusted-by-the).

#### Intermediate certificate

An intermediate certificate can now be created from the root certificate. This isn't required for all use cases, but you might need to create many certificates or need to activate or disable groups of certificates. The `TextExtension` parameter is required to set the path length in the basic constraints of the certificate.

The intermediate certificate can then be added to the trusted intermediate certificate in the Windows host system.

```powershell
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

$parentcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\"The thumbprint of the root..." )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "intermediate_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $parentcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "intermediate_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature -TextExtension @("2.5.29.19={text}CA=1&pathlength=1")

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\intermediate_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath intermediate_dev_damienbod.crt
```

#### Create child certificate from intermediate certificate

A child certificate can be created from the intermediate certificate. This is the end entity and doesn't need to create more child certificates.

```powershell
$parentcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\"The thumbprint from the Intermediate certificate..." )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "child_a_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $parentcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "child_a_dev_damienbod.com"

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\child_a_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath child_a_dev_damienbod.crt
```

#### Create child certificate from root certificate

A child certificate can also be created from the root certificate directly. 

```powershell
$rootcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\"The thumbprint from the root cert..." )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "child_a_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $rootcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "child_a_dev_damienbod.com"

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\child_a_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath child_a_dev_damienbod.crt
```

#### Example root - intermediate certificate - certificate

```powershell
$mypwdroot = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com", "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature

```

When using the root, intermediate, or child certificates, the certificates can be validated using the Thumbprint or PublicKey as required.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

namespace AspNetCoreCertificateAuthApi
{
    public class MyCertificateValidationService 
    {
        public bool ValidateCertificate(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
        {
            return CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(clientCertificate);
        }

        private bool CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
        {
            var listOfValidThumbprints = new List<string>
            {
                "141594A0AE38CBBECED7AF680F7945CD51D8F28A",
                "0C89639E4E2998A93E423F919B36D4009A0F9991",
                "BA9BF91ED35538A01375EFC212A2F46104B33A44"
            };

            if (listOfValidThumbprints.Contains(clientCertificate.Thumbprint))
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

## Certificate validation caching

ASP.NET Core 5.0 and later versions support the ability to enable caching of validation results. The caching dramatically improves performance of certificate authentication, as validation is an expensive operation.

By default, certificate authentication disables caching. To enable caching, call `AddCertificateCache` in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(
        CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
            .AddCertificate()
            .AddCertificateCache(options =>
            {
                options.CacheSize = 1024;
                options.CacheEntryExpiration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);
            });
}
```

The default caching implementation stores results in memory. You can provide your own cache by implementing `ICertificateValidationCache` and registering it with dependency injection. For example, `services.AddSingleton<ICertificateValidationCache, YourCache>()`.

## Optional client certificates

This section provides information for apps that must protect a subset of the app with a certificate. For example, a Razor Page or controller in the app might require client certificates. This presents challenges as client certificates:
  
* Are a TLS feature, not an HTTP feature.
* Are negotiated per-connection and usually at the start of the connection before any HTTP data is available. 

There are two approaches to implementing optional client certificates:
1. Using separate host names (SNI) and redirecting. While more work to configure, this is recommended because it works in most environments and protocols.
2. Renegotiation during an HTTP request. This has several limitations and is not recommended.

### Separate Hosts (SNI)

At the start of the connection, only the Server Name Indication (SNI)&dagger; is known. Client certificates can be configured per host name so that one host requires them and another does not.

* Set up binding for the domain and subdomain:
  * For example, set up bindings on `contoso.com` and `myClient.contoso.com`. The `contoso.com` host doesn't require a client certificate but `myClient.contoso.com` does.

ASP.NET Core 5 and later adds more convenient support for redirecting to acquire optional client certificates. For more information, see the [Optional certificates sample](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/9ce4a970a21bace3fb262da9591ed52359309592/src/Security/Authentication/Certificate/samples/Certificate.Optional.Sample).

* For requests to the web app that require a client certificate and don't have one:
  * Redirect to the same page using the client certificate protected subdomain.
  * For example, redirect to `myClient.contoso.com/requestedPage`. Because the request to `myClient.contoso.com/requestedPage` is a different hostname than `contoso.com/requestedPage`, the client establishes a different connection and the client certificate is provided.
  * For more information, see <xref:security/authorization/introduction>.

&dagger; Server Name Indication (SNI) is a TLS extension to include a virtual domain as a part of SSL negotiation. This effectively means the virtual domain name, or a hostname, can be used to identify the network end point.

### Renegotiation

TLS renegotiation is a process by which the client and server can re-assess the encryption requirements for an individual connection, including requesting a client certificate if not previously provided. TLS renegotiation is a security risk and isn't recommended because:

* In HTTP/1.1 the server must first buffer or consume any HTTP data that is in flight such as POST request bodies to make sure the connection is clear for the renegotiation. Otherwise the renegotiation can stop responding or fail.
* HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 [explicitly prohibit](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2.1) renegotiation.
* There are security risks associated with renegotiation. TLS 1.3 removed renegotiation of the whole connection and replaced it with a new extension for requesting only the client certificate after the start of the connection. This mechanism is exposed via the same APIs and is still subject to the prior constraints of buffering and HTTP protocol versions.

The implementation and configuration of this feature varies by server and framework version.

#### IIS

IIS manages the client certificate negotiation on your behalf. A subsection of the application can enable the `SslRequireCert` option to negotiate the client certificate for those requests. See [Configuration in the IIS documentation](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/access#configuration) for details.

IIS will automatically buffer any request body data up to a configured size limit before renegotiating. Requests that exceed the limit are rejected with a 413 response. This limit defaults to 48MB and is configurable by setting the [uploadReadAheadSize](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/serverruntime).

#### HttpSys

HttpSys has two settings which control the client certificate negotiation and both should be set. The first is in netsh.exe under `http add sslcert clientcertnegotiation=enable/disable`. This flag indicates if the client certificate should be negotiated at the start of a connection and it should be set to `disable` for optional client certificates. See the [netsh docs](/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-http#add-sslcert) for details.

The other setting is <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys.HttpSysOptions.ClientCertificateMethod>. When set to `AllowRenegotation`, the client certificate can be renegotiated during a request.

*NOTE* The application should buffer or consume any request body data before attempting the renegotiation, otherwise the request may become unresponsive.

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/33586) where enabling `AllowRenegotation` can cause the renegotiation to happen synchronously when accessing the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.ClientCertificate> property. Call the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.GetClientCertificateAsync%2A> method to avoid this. This has been addressed in .NET 6. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/466). Note `GetClientCertificateAsync` can return a null certificate if the client declines to provide one.

#### Kestrel

Kestrel controls client certificate negotation with the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions.ClientCertificateMode> option.

For .NET 5 and earlier Kestrel does not support renegotiating after the start of a connection to acquire a client certificate. This feature has been added in .NET 6.

`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate` contains an implementation similar to [Certificate Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.4) for ASP.NET Core. Certificate authentication happens at the TLS level, long before it ever gets to ASP.NET Core. More accurately, this is an authentication handler that validates the certificate and then gives you an event where you can resolve that certificate to a `ClaimsPrincipal`. 

[Configure your server](#configure-your-server-to-require-certificates) for certificate authentication, be it IIS, Kestrel, Azure Web Apps, or whatever else you're using.

## Proxy and load balancer scenarios

Certificate authentication is a stateful scenario primarily used where a proxy or load balancer doesn't handle traffic between clients and servers. If a proxy or load balancer is used, certificate authentication only works if the proxy or load balancer:

* Handles the authentication.
* Passes the user authentication information to the app (for example, in a request header), which acts on the authentication information.

An alternative to certificate authentication in environments where proxies and load balancers are used is Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) with OpenID Connect (OIDC).

## Get started

Acquire an HTTPS certificate, apply it, and [configure your server](#configure-your-server-to-require-certificates) to require certificates.

In your web app, add a reference to the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate) package. Then in the `Startup.ConfigureServices` method, call
`services.AddAuthentication(CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddCertificate(...);` with your options, providing a delegate for `OnCertificateValidated` to do any supplementary validation on the client certificate sent with requests. Turn that information into a `ClaimsPrincipal` and set it on the `context.Principal` property.

If authentication fails, this handler returns a `403 (Forbidden)` response rather a `401 (Unauthorized)`, as you might expect. The reasoning is that the authentication should happen during the initial TLS connection. By the time it reaches the handler, it's too late. There's no way to upgrade the connection from an anonymous connection to one with a certificate.

Also add `app.UseAuthentication();` in the `Startup.Configure` method. Otherwise, the `HttpContext.User` will not be set to `ClaimsPrincipal` created from the certificate. For example:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(
        CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddCertificate();

    // All other service configuration
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseAuthentication();

    // All other app configuration
}
```

The preceding example demonstrates the default way to add certificate authentication. The handler constructs a user principal using the common certificate properties.

## Configure certificate validation

The `CertificateAuthenticationOptions` handler has some built-in validations that are the minimum validations you should perform on a certificate. Each of these settings is enabled by default.

### AllowedCertificateTypes = Chained, SelfSigned, or All (Chained | SelfSigned)

Default value: `CertificateTypes.Chained`

This check validates that only the appropriate certificate type is allowed. If the app is using self-signed certificates, this option needs to be set to `CertificateTypes.All` or `CertificateTypes.SelfSigned`.

### ValidateCertificateUse

Default value: `true`

This check validates that the certificate presented by the client has the Client Authentication extended key use (EKU), or no EKUs at all. As the specifications say, if no EKU is specified, then all EKUs are deemed valid.

### ValidateValidityPeriod

Default value: `true`

This check validates that the certificate is within its validity period. On each request, the handler ensures that a certificate that was valid when it was presented hasn't expired during its current session.

### RevocationFlag

Default value: `X509RevocationFlag.ExcludeRoot`

A flag that specifies which certificates in the chain are checked for revocation.

Revocation checks are only performed when the certificate is chained to a root certificate.

### RevocationMode

Default value: `X509RevocationMode.Online`

A flag that specifies how revocation checks are performed.

Specifying an online check can result in a long delay while the certificate authority is contacted.

Revocation checks are only performed when the certificate is chained to a root certificate.

### Can I configure my app to require a certificate only on certain paths?

This isn't possible. Remember the certificate exchange is done at the start of the HTTPS conversation, it's done by the server before the first request is received on that connection so it's not possible to scope based on any request fields.

## Handler events

The handler has two events:

* `OnAuthenticationFailed`: Called if an exception happens during authentication and allows you to react.
* `OnCertificateValidated`: Called after the certificate has been validated, passed validation and a default principal has been created. This event allows you to perform your own validation and augment or replace the principal. For examples include:
  * Determining if the certificate is known to your services.
  * Constructing your own principal. Consider the following example in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication(
        CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddCertificate(options =>
        {
            options.Events = new CertificateAuthenticationEvents
            {
                OnCertificateValidated = context =>
                {
                    var claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim(
                            ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, 
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject,
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer),
                        new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name,
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject,
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer)
                    };
    
                    context.Principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(
                        new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Scheme.Name));
                    context.Success();
    
                    return Task.CompletedTask;
                }
            };
        });
    ```

If you find the inbound certificate doesn't meet your extra validation, call `context.Fail("failure reason")` with a failure reason.

For real functionality, you'll probably want to call a service registered in dependency injection that connects to a database or other type of user store. Access your service by using the context passed into your delegate. Consider the following example in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddAuthentication(
    CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCertificate(options =>
    {
        options.Events = new CertificateAuthenticationEvents
        {
            OnCertificateValidated = context =>
            {
                var validationService =
                    context.HttpContext.RequestServices
                        .GetRequiredService<ICertificateValidationService>();
                
                if (validationService.ValidateCertificate(
                    context.ClientCertificate))
                {
                    var claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim(
                            ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, 
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject, 
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer),
                        new Claim(
                            ClaimTypes.Name, 
                            context.ClientCertificate.Subject, 
                            ClaimValueTypes.String, 
                            context.Options.ClaimsIssuer)
                    };

                    context.Principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(
                        new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Scheme.Name));
                    context.Success();
                }                     

                return Task.CompletedTask;
            }
        };
    });
```

Conceptually, the validation of the certificate is an authorization concern. Adding a check on, for example, an issuer or thumbprint in an authorization policy, rather than inside `OnCertificateValidated`, is perfectly acceptable.

## Configure your server to require certificates

### Kestrel

In `Program.cs`, configure Kestrel as follows:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
}

public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args)
{
    return Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            webBuilder.ConfigureKestrel(o =>
            {
                o.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(o => 
                    o.ClientCertificateMode =  ClientCertificateMode.RequireCertificate);
            });
        });
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Endpoints created by calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerOptions.Listen%2A> **before** calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerOptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults%2A> won't have the defaults applied.

### IIS

Complete the following steps in IIS Manager:

1. Select your site from the **Connections** tab.
1. Double-click the **SSL Settings** option in the **Features View** window.
1. Check the **Require SSL** checkbox, and select the **Require** radio button in the **Client certificates** section.

### Azure and custom web proxies

See the [host and deploy documentation](xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer#certificate-forwarding) for how to configure the certificate forwarding middleware.

### Use certificate authentication in Azure Web Apps

No forwarding configuration is required for Azure. Forwarding configuration is set up by the Certificate Forwarding Middleware.

> [!NOTE]
> Certificate Forwarding Middleware is required for this scenario.

For more information, see [Use a TLS/SSL certificate in your code in Azure App Service (Azure documentation)](/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate-in-code).

### Use certificate authentication in custom web proxies

The `AddCertificateForwarding` method is used to specify:

* The client header name.
* How the certificate is to be loaded (using the `HeaderConverter` property).

In custom web proxies, the certificate is passed as a custom request header, for example `X-SSL-CERT`. To use it, configure certificate forwarding in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCertificateForwarding(options =>
    {
        options.CertificateHeader = "X-SSL-CERT";
        options.HeaderConverter = (headerValue) =>
        {
            X509Certificate2 clientCertificate = null;

            if(!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(headerValue))
            {
                byte[] bytes = StringToByteArray(headerValue);
                clientCertificate = new X509Certificate2(bytes);
            }

            return clientCertificate;
        };
    });
}

private static byte[] StringToByteArray(string hex)
{
    int NumberChars = hex.Length;
    byte[] bytes = new byte[NumberChars / 2];

    for (int i = 0; i < NumberChars; i += 2)
    {
        bytes[i / 2] = Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(i, 2), 16);
    }

    return bytes;
}
```

If the app is reverse proxied by NGINX with the configuration `proxy_set_header ssl-client-cert $ssl_client_escaped_cert` or deployed on Kubernetes using NGINX Ingress, the client certificate is passed to the app in [URL-encoded form](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding). To use the certificate, decode it as follows:

Add the namespace for <xref:System.Net?displayProperty=fullName> to the top of `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
using System.Net;
```

In `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddCertificateForwarding(options =>
{
    options.CertificateHeader = "ssl-client-cert";
    options.HeaderConverter = (headerValue) =>
    {
        X509Certificate2 clientCertificate = null;

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(headerValue))
        {
            var bytes = UrlEncodedPemToByteArray(headerValue);
            clientCertificate = new X509Certificate2(bytes);
        }

        return clientCertificate;
    };
});
```

Add the `UrlEncodedPemToByteArray` method:

```csharp
private static byte[] UrlEncodedPemToByteArray(string urlEncodedBase64Pem)
{
    var base64Pem = WebUtility.UrlDecode(urlEncodedBase64Pem);
    var base64Cert = base64Pem
        .Replace("-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----", string.Empty)
        .Replace("-----END CERTIFICATE-----", string.Empty)
        .Trim();

    return Convert.FromBase64String(base64Cert);
}
```

The `Startup.Configure` method then adds the middleware. `UseCertificateForwarding` is called before the calls to `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization`:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseCertificateForwarding();
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

A separate class can be used to implement validation logic. Because the same self-signed certificate is used in this example, ensure that only your certificate can be used. Validate that the thumbprints of both the client certificate and the server certificate match, otherwise any certificate can be used and will be enough to authenticate. This would be used inside the `AddCertificate` method. You could also validate the subject or the issuer here if you're using intermediate or child certificates.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

namespace AspNetCoreCertificateAuthApi
{
    public class MyCertificateValidationService
    {
        public bool ValidateCertificate(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
        {
            // Do not hardcode passwords in production code
            // Use thumbprint or key vault
            var cert = new X509Certificate2(
                Path.Combine("sts_dev_cert.pfx"), "1234");

            if (clientCertificate.Thumbprint == cert.Thumbprint)
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Implement an HttpClient using a certificate and the HttpClientHandler

The `HttpClientHandler` could be added directly in the constructor of the `HttpClient` class. Care should be taken when creating instances of the `HttpClient`. The `HttpClient` will then send the certificate with each request.

```csharp
private async Task<JsonDocument> GetApiDataUsingHttpClientHandler()
{
    var cert = new X509Certificate2(Path.Combine(_environment.ContentRootPath, "sts_dev_cert.pfx"), "1234");
    var handler = new HttpClientHandler();
    handler.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);
    var client = new HttpClient(handler);
     
    var request = new HttpRequestMessage()
    {
        RequestUri = new Uri("https://localhost:44379/api/values"),
        Method = HttpMethod.Get,
    };
    var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        var data = JsonDocument.Parse(responseContent);
        return data;
    }
 
    throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
}
```

#### Implement an HttpClient using a certificate and a named HttpClient from IHttpClientFactory 

In the following example, a client certificate is added to a `HttpClientHandler` using the `ClientCertificates` property from the handler. This handler can then be used in a named instance of an `HttpClient` using the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HttpClientBuilderExtensions.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler%2A> method. This is setup in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
var clientCertificate = 
    new X509Certificate2(
      Path.Combine(_environment.ContentRootPath, "sts_dev_cert.pfx"), "1234");

services.AddHttpClient("namedClient", c =>
{
}).ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() =>
{
    var handler = new HttpClientHandler();
    handler.ClientCertificates.Add(clientCertificate);
    return handler;
});
```

The `IHttpClientFactory` can then be used to get the named instance with the handler and the certificate. The `CreateClient` method with the name of the client defined in the `Startup` class is used to get the instance. The HTTP request can be sent using the client as required.

```csharp
private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
 
public ApiService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
{
    _clientFactory = clientFactory;
}
 
private async Task<JsonDocument> GetApiDataWithNamedClient()
{
    var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("namedClient");
 
    var request = new HttpRequestMessage()
    {
        RequestUri = new Uri("https://localhost:44379/api/values"),
        Method = HttpMethod.Get,
    };
    var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        var data = JsonDocument.Parse(responseContent);
        return data;
    }
 
    throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
}
```

If the correct certificate is sent to the server, the data is returned. If no certificate or the wrong certificate is sent, an HTTP 403 status code is returned.

### Create certificates in PowerShell

Creating the certificates is the hardest part in setting up this flow. A root certificate can be created using the `New-SelfSignedCertificate` PowerShell cmdlet. When creating the certificate, use a strong password. It's important to add the `KeyUsageProperty` parameter and the `KeyUsage` parameter as shown.

#### Create root CA

```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com", "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "root_ca_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature

$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\root_ca_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath root_ca_dev_damienbod.crt
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-DnsName` parameter value must match the deployment target of the app. For example, "localhost" for development.

#### Install in the trusted root

The root certificate needs to be trusted on your host system. A root certificate which was not created by a certificate authority won't be trusted by default. For information on how to trust the root certificate on Windows, see [this question](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/SqlServer/5ed119ef-1704-4be4-8a4f-ef11de7c8f34/a-certificate-chain-processed-but-terminated-in-a-root-certificate-which-is-not-trusted-by-the).

#### Intermediate certificate

An intermediate certificate can now be created from the root certificate. This isn't required for all use cases, but you might need to create many certificates or need to activate or disable groups of certificates. The `TextExtension` parameter is required to set the path length in the basic constraints of the certificate.

The intermediate certificate can then be added to the trusted intermediate certificate in the Windows host system.

```powershell
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

$parentcert = ( Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\"The thumbprint of the root..." )

New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\localmachine\my -dnsname "intermediate_dev_damienbod.com" -Signer $parentcert -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -FriendlyName "intermediate_dev_damienbod.com" -KeyUsageProperty All -KeyUsage CertSign, CRLSign, DigitalSignature -TextExtension @("2.5.29.19={text}CA=1&pathlength=1")

Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\git\AspNetCoreCertificateAuth\Certs\intermediate_dev_damienbod.pfx -Password $mypwd

Export-Certificate -Cert cert:\localMachine\my\"The thumbprint..." -FilePath intermediate_dev_damienbod.crt
```

#### Create child certificate from intermediate certificate

A child certificate can be created from the intermediate certificate. This is the end entity and doesn't need to create more child certificates.

```powershell

When using the root, intermediate, or child certificates, the certificates can be validated using the Thumbprint or PublicKey as required.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

namespace AspNetCoreCertificateAuthApi
{
    public class MyCertificateValidationService 
    {
        public bool ValidateCertificate(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
        {
            return CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(clientCertificate);
        }

        private bool CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
        {
            var listOfValidThumbprints = new List<string>
            {
                "141594A0AE38CBBECED7AF680F7945CD51D8F28A",
                "0C89639E4E2998A93E423F919B36D4009A0F9991",
                "BA9BF91ED35538A01375EFC212A2F46104B33A44"
            };

            if (listOfValidThumbprints.Contains(clientCertificate.Thumbprint))
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }
    }
}

## Optional client certificates

This section provides information for apps that must protect a subset of the app with a certificate. For example, a Razor Page or controller in the app might require client certificates. This presents challenges as client certificates:
  
* Are a TLS feature, not an HTTP feature.
* Are negotiated per-connection and usually at the start of the connection before any HTTP data is available. 

There are two approaches to implementing optional client certificates:
1. Using separate host names (SNI) and redirecting. While more work to configure, this is recommended because it works in most environments and protocols.
2. Renegotiation during an HTTP request. This has several limitations and is not recommended.

### Separate Hosts (SNI)

At the start of the connection, only the Server Name Indication (SNI)&dagger; is known. Client certificates can be configured per host name so that one host requires them and another does not.

* Set up binding for the domain and subdomain:
  * For example, set up bindings on `contoso.com` and `myClient.contoso.com`. The `contoso.com` host doesn't require a client certificate but `myClient.contoso.com` does.
  * For more information, see:
    * <xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel>:
      * [ListenOptions.UseHttps](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#listenoptionsusehttps)
      * <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions.ClientCertificateMode>
      * Note Kestrel does not currently support multiple TLS configurations on one binding, you'll need two bindings with unique IPs or ports. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/31097).
    * IIS
      * [Hosting IIS](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index#create-the-iis-site)
      * [Configure security on IIS](/iis/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis#configure-ssl-settings-2)
    * HTTP.sys: [Configure Windows Server](xref:fundamentals/servers/httpsys#configure-windows-server)

ASP.NET Core 5 and later adds more convenient support for redirecting to acquire optional client certificates. For more information, see the [Optional certificates sample](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/9ce4a970a21bace3fb262da9591ed52359309592/src/Security/Authentication/Certificate/samples/Certificate.Optional.Sample).

* For requests to the web app that require a client certificate and don't have one:
  * Redirect to the same page using the client certificate protected subdomain.
  * For example, redirect to `myClient.contoso.com/requestedPage`. Because the request to `myClient.contoso.com/requestedPage` is a different hostname than `contoso.com/requestedPage`, the client establishes a different connection and the client certificate is provided.
  * For more information, see <xref:security/authorization/introduction>.

&dagger; Server Name Indication (SNI) is a TLS extension to include a virtual domain as a part of SSL negotiation. This effectively means the virtual domain name, or a hostname, can be used to identify the network end point.

### Renegotiation

TLS renegotiation is a process by which the client and server can re-assess the encryption requirements for an individual connection, including requesting a client certificate if not previously provided. TLS renegotiation is a security risk and isn't recommended because:

* In HTTP/1.1 the server must first buffer or consume any HTTP data that is in flight such as POST request bodies to make sure the connection is clear for the renegotiation. Otherwise the renegotiation can stop responding or fail.
* HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 [explicitly prohibit](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2.1) renegotiation.
* There are security risks associated with renegotiation. TLS 1.3 removed renegotiation of the whole connection and replaced it with a new extension for requesting only the client certificate after the start of the connection. This mechanism is exposed via the same APIs and is still subject to the prior constraints of buffering and HTTP protocol versions.

The implementation and configuration of this feature varies by server and framework version.

#### IIS

IIS manages the client certificate negotiation on your behalf. A subsection of the application can enable the `SslRequireCert` option to negotiate the client certificate for those requests. See [Configuration in the IIS documentation](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/access#configuration) for details.

IIS will automatically buffer any request body data up to a configured size limit before renegotiating. Requests that exceed the limit are rejected with a 413 response. This limit defaults to 48MB and is configurable by setting the [uploadReadAheadSize](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/serverruntime).

#### HttpSys

HttpSys has two settings which control the client certificate negotiation and both should be set. The first is in netsh.exe under `http add sslcert clientcertnegotiation=enable/disable`. This flag indicates if the client certificate should be negotiated at the start of a connection and it should be set to `disable` for optional client certificates. See the [netsh docs](/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-http#add-sslcert) for details.

The other setting is <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.HttpSys.HttpSysOptions.ClientCertificateMethod>. When set to `AllowRenegotation`, the client certificate can be renegotiated during a request.

*NOTE* The application should buffer or consume any request body data before attempting the renegotiation, otherwise the request may become unresponsive.

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/33586) where enabling `AllowRenegotation` can cause the renegotiation to happen synchronously when accessing the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.ClientCertificate> property. Call the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo.GetClientCertificateAsync%2A> method to avoid this. This has been addressed in .NET 6. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/466). Note `GetClientCertificateAsync` can return a null certificate if the client declines to provide one.

#### Kestrel

Kestrel controls client certificate negotation with the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions.ClientCertificateMode> option.

For .NET 5 and earlier Kestrel does not support renegotiating after the start of a connection to acquire a client certificate. This feature has been added in .NET 6.
