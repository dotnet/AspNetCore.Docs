# Scaffold Identity in ASP.NET Core projects

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

<!-- VS add Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design -->

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

ASP.NET Core provides [ASP.NET Core Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) as a [Razor Class Library](xref:razor-pages/ui-class). Applications that include Identity can apply the scaffolder to selectively add the source code contained in the Identity Razor Class Library (RCL). You might want to generate source code so you can modify the code and change the behavior. For example, you could instruct the scaffolder to generate the code used in registration. Generated code takes precedence over the same code in the Identity RCL. To gain full control of the UI and not use the default RCL, see the section [Create full Identity UI source](#full).

Applications that do **not** include authentication can apply the scaffolder to add the RCL Identity package. You have the option of selecting Identity code to be generated.

Although the scaffolder generates most of the necessary code, you need to update your project to complete the process. This document explains the steps needed to complete an Identity scaffolding update.

We recommend using a source control system that shows file differences and allows you to back out of changes. Inspect the changes after running the Identity scaffolder.

Services are required when using [Two Factor Authentication](xref:security/authentication/identity-enable-qrcodes), [Account confirmation and password recovery](xref:security/authentication/accconfirm), and other security features with Identity. Services or service stubs aren't generated when scaffolding Identity. Services to enable these features must be added manually. For example, see [Require Email Confirmation](xref:security/authentication/accconfirm#require-email-confirmation).

Typically, apps that were created with individual accounts should ***not*** create a new data context.

## Scaffold Identity into a Blazor Server project

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/install-pkg.md)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/id-scaffold-dlg-auth.md)]

### Migrations

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/migrations.md)]

### Pass an XSRF token to the app

Tokens can be passed to components:

* When authentication tokens are provisioned and saved to the authentication cookie, they can be passed to components.
* Razor components can't use `HttpContext` directly, so there's no way to obtain an [anti-request forgery (XSRF) token](xref:security/anti-request-forgery) to POST to Identity's logout endpoint at `/Identity/Account/Logout`. An XSRF token can be passed to components.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-blazor-server-app>.

In the `Pages/_Host.cshtml` file, establish the token after adding it to the `InitialApplicationState` and `TokenProvider` classes:

```csharp
@inject Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.IAntiforgery Xsrf

...

var tokens = new InitialApplicationState
{
    ...

    XsrfToken = Xsrf.GetAndStoreTokens(HttpContext).RequestToken
};
```

Update the `App` component (`App.razor`) to assign the `InitialState.XsrfToken`:

```csharp
@inject TokenProvider TokenProvider

...

TokenProvider.XsrfToken = InitialState.XsrfToken;
```

The `TokenProvider` service demonstrated in the topic is used in the `LoginDisplay` component in the following [Layout and authentication flow changes](#layout-and-authentication-flow-changes) section.

### Register the token provider service

If using a [token provider service](xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-blazor-server-app), register the service in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<TokenProvider>();
```

### Layout and authentication flow changes

Add a `RedirectToLogin` component (`RedirectToLogin.razor`) to the app's `Shared` folder in the project root:

```razor
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        Navigation.NavigateTo("Identity/Account/Login?returnUrl=" +
            Uri.EscapeDataString(Navigation.Uri), true);
    }
}
```

Add a `LoginDisplay` component (`LoginDisplay.razor`) to the app's `Shared` folder. A [token provider service](xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-blazor-server-app), `TokenProvider` in the following example, provides the XSRF token for the HTML form that POSTs to Identity's logout endpoint:

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@inject TokenProvider TokenProvider

<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <a href="Identity/Account/Manage/Index">
            Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!
        </a>
        <form action="/Identity/Account/Logout?returnUrl=%2F" method="post">
            <button class="nav-link btn btn-link" type="submit">Logout</button>
            <input name="__RequestVerificationToken" type="hidden" 
                value="@TokenProvider.XsrfToken">
        </form>
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <a href="Identity/Account/Register">Register</a>
        <a href="Identity/Account/Login">Login</a>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

In the `MainLayout` component (`Shared/MainLayout.razor`), add the `LoginDisplay` component to the top-row `<div>` element's content:

```razor
<div class="top-row px-4 auth">
    <LoginDisplay />
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/" target="_blank">About</a>
</div>
```

### Style authentication endpoints

Because Blazor Server uses Razor Pages Identity pages, the styling of the UI changes when a visitor navigates between Identity pages and components. You have two options to address the incongruous styles:

#### Build Identity components

An approach to using components for Identity instead of pages is to build Identity components. Because `SignInManager` and `UserManager` aren't supported in Razor components, use API endpoints in the Blazor Server app to process user account actions.

#### Use a custom layout with Blazor app styles

The Identity pages layout and styles can be modified to produce pages that use the default Blazor theme.

> [!NOTE]
> The example in this section is merely a starting point for customization. Additional work is likely required for the best user experience.

Create a new `NavMenu_IdentityLayout` component (`Shared/NavMenu_IdentityLayout.razor`). For the markup and code of the component, use the same content of the app's `NavMenu` component (`Shared/NavMenu.razor`). Strip out any `NavLink`s to components that can't be reached anonymously because automatic redirects in the `RedirectToLogin` component fail for components requiring authentication or authorization.

In the `Pages/Shared/Layout.cshtml` file, make the following changes:

* Add Razor directives to the top of the file to use Tag Helpers and the app's components in the `Shared` folder:

  ```cshtml
  @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
  @using {APPLICATION ASSEMBLY}.Shared
  ```

  Replace `{APPLICATION ASSEMBLY}` with the app's assembly name.

* Add a `<base>` tag and Blazor stylesheet `<link>` to the `<head>` content:

  ```cshtml
  <base href="~/" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
  ```

* Change the content of the `<body>` tag to the following:

  ```cshtml
  <div class="sidebar" style="float:left">
      <component type="typeof(NavMenu_IdentityLayout)" 
          render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
  </div>

  <div class="main" style="padding-left:250px">
      <div class="top-row px-4">
          @{
              var result = Engine.FindView(ViewContext, "_LoginPartial", 
                  isMainPage: false);
          }
          @if (result.Success)
          {
              await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_LoginPartial");
          }
          else
          {
              throw new InvalidOperationException("The default Identity UI " +
                  "layout requires a partial view '_LoginPartial'.");
          }
          <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/" target="_blank">About</a>
      </div>

      <div class="content px-4">
          @RenderBody()
      </div>
  </div>

  <script src="~/Identity/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="~/Identity/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.js"></script>
  <script src="~/Identity/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>
  @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
  <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
  ```

## Standalone or hosted Blazor WebAssembly apps

Client-side Blazor WebAssembly apps use their own Identity UI approaches and can't use ASP.NET Core Identity scaffolding. Server-side ASP.NET Core apps of hosted Blazor solutions can follow the Razor Pages/MVC guidance in this article and are configured just like any other type of ASP.NET Core app that supports Identity.

The Blazor framework doesn't include Razor component versions of Identity UI pages. Identity UI Razor components can be custom built or obtained from unsupported third-party sources.

For more information, see the [Blazor Security and Identity articles](xref:blazor/security/index).

<a name="full"></a>

## Create full Identity UI source
<!-- remove AllowAreas  #23280 -->
To maintain full control of the Identity UI, run the Identity scaffolder and select **Override all files**.

<!--
uld option: Use Local DB, not SQLite

dotnet new webapp -au Individual -uld -o RPauth
cd RPauth
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc RPauth.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.RegisterConfirmation"
-->

## Password configuration

If <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.PasswordOptions> are configured in `Startup.ConfigureServices`, [`[StringLength]` attribute](xref:System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLengthAttribute) configuration might be required for the `Password` property in scaffolded Identity pages. `InputModel` `Password` properties are found in the following files:

* `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs`
* `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ResetPassword.cshtml.cs`

## Disable a page

This sections show how to disable the register page but the approach can be used to disable any page.

To disable user registration:

* Scaffold Identity. Include Account.Register, Account.Login, and Account.RegisterConfirmation. For example:

  ```dotnetcli
   dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc RPauth.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.RegisterConfirmation"
  ```

* Update `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs` so users can't register from this endpoint:

  [!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/Register.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

* Update `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml` to be consistent with the preceding changes:

  [!code-cshtml[](scaffold-identity/sample/Register.cshtml)]

* Comment out or remove the registration link from `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Login.cshtml`

  ```cshtml
  @*
  <p>
      <a asp-page="./Register" asp-route-returnUrl="@Model.ReturnUrl">Register as a new user</a>
  </p>
  *@
  ```

* Update the *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/RegisterConfirmation* page.

  * Remove the code and links from the cshtml file.
  * Remove the confirmation code from the `PageModel`:

  ```csharp
   [AllowAnonymous]
    public class RegisterConfirmationModel : PageModel
    {
        public IActionResult OnGet()
        {  
            return Page();
        }
    }
  ```
  
### Use another app to add users

Provide a mechanism to add users outside the web app. Options to add users include:

* A dedicated admin web app.
* A console app.

The following code outlines one approach to adding users:

* A list of users is read into memory.
* A strong unique password is generated for each user.
* The user is added to the Identity database.
* The user is notified and told to change the password.

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/consoleAddUser/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

The following code outlines adding a user:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/consoleAddUser/Data/SeedData.cs?name=snippet)]

A similar approach can be followed for production scenarios.

## Prevent publish of static Identity assets

ASP.NET Core provides [ASP.NET Core Identity](xref:security/authentication/identity) as a [Razor Class Library](xref:razor-pages/ui-class).

We recommend using a source control system that shows file differences and allows you to back out of changes. Inspect the changes after running the Identity scaffolder.

Services are required when using [Two Factor Authentication](xref:security/authentication/identity-enable-qrcodes), [Account confirmation and password recovery](xref:security/authentication/accconfirm), and other security features with Identity. Services or service stubs aren't generated when scaffolding Identity. Services to enable these features must be added manually. For example, see [Require Email Confirmation](xref:security/authentication/accconfirm#require-email-confirmation).

When scaffolding Identity with a new data context into a project with existing individual accounts:

* In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, remove the calls to:
  * `AddDbContext`
  * `AddDefaultIdentity`

For example, `AddDbContext` and `AddDefaultIdentity` are commented out in the following code:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/StartupRemove.cs?name=snippet)]

The preceding code comments out the code that is duplicated in `Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs`

Typically, apps that were created with individual accounts should ***not*** create a new data context.

### Migrations

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/migrations.md)]

### Pass an XSRF token to the app

Tokens can be passed to components:

* When authentication tokens are provisioned and saved to the authentication cookie, they can be passed to components.
* Razor components can't use `HttpContext` directly, so there's no way to obtain an [anti-request forgery (XSRF) token](xref:security/anti-request-forgery) to POST to Identity's logout endpoint at `/Identity/Account/Logout`. An XSRF token can be passed to components.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-blazor-server-app>.

In the `Pages/_Host.cshtml` file, establish the token after adding it to the `InitialApplicationState` and `TokenProvider` classes:

```csharp
@inject Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.IAntiforgery Xsrf

...

var tokens = new InitialApplicationState
{
    ...

    XsrfToken = Xsrf.GetAndStoreTokens(HttpContext).RequestToken
};
```

Update the `App` component (`App.razor`) to assign the `InitialState.XsrfToken`:

```csharp
@inject TokenProvider TokenProvider

...

TokenProvider.XsrfToken = InitialState.XsrfToken;
```

The `TokenProvider` service demonstrated in the topic is used in the `LoginDisplay` component in the following [Layout and authentication flow changes](#layout-and-authentication-flow-changes) section.

### Enable authentication

In the `Startup` class:

* Confirm that Razor Pages services are added in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.
* If using the [TokenProvider](xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-blazor-server-app), register the service.
* Call `UseDatabaseErrorPage` on the application builder in `Startup.Configure` for the Development environment.
* Call `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization` after `UseRouting`.
* Add an endpoint for Razor Pages.

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/3.1sample/StartupBlazor.cs?highlight=3,6,14,27-28,32)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/hsts.md)]

### Layout and authentication flow changes

Add a `RedirectToLogin` component (`RedirectToLogin.razor`) to the app's *Shared* folder in the project root:

```razor
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        Navigation.NavigateTo("Identity/Account/Login?returnUrl=" +
            Uri.EscapeDataString(Navigation.Uri), true);
    }
}
```

Add a `LoginDisplay` component (`LoginDisplay.razor`) to the app's *Shared* folder. The [TokenProvider service](xref:blazor/security/server/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-blazor-server-app) provides the XSRF token for the HTML form that POSTs to Identity's logout endpoint:

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@inject TokenProvider TokenProvider

<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <a href="Identity/Account/Manage/Index">
            Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!
        </a>
        <form action="/Identity/Account/Logout?returnUrl=%2F" method="post">
            <button class="nav-link btn btn-link" type="submit">Logout</button>
            <input name="__RequestVerificationToken" type="hidden" 
                value="@TokenProvider.XsrfToken">
        </form>
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <a href="Identity/Account/Register">Register</a>
        <a href="Identity/Account/Login">Login</a>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

In the `MainLayout` component (`Shared/MainLayout.razor`), add the `LoginDisplay` component to the top-row `<div>` element's content:

```razor
<div class="top-row px-4 auth">
    <LoginDisplay />
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/" target="_blank">About</a>
</div>
```

### Style authentication endpoints

Because Blazor Server uses Razor Pages Identity pages, the styling of the UI changes when a visitor navigates between Identity pages and components. You have two options to address the incongruous styles:

#### Build Identity components

An approach to using components for Identity instead of pages is to build Identity components. Because `SignInManager` and `UserManager` aren't supported in Razor components, use API endpoints in the Blazor Server app to process user account actions.

#### Use a custom layout with Blazor app styles

The Identity pages layout and styles can be modified to produce pages that use the default Blazor theme.

> [!NOTE]
> The example in this section is merely a starting point for customization. Additional work is likely required for the best user experience.

Create a new `NavMenu_IdentityLayout` component (`Shared/NavMenu_IdentityLayout.razor`). For the markup and code of the component, use the same content of the app's `NavMenu` component (`Shared/NavMenu.razor`). Strip out any `NavLink`s to components that can't be reached anonymously because automatic redirects in the `RedirectToLogin` component fail for components requiring authentication or authorization.

In the `Pages/Shared/Layout.cshtml` file, make the following changes:

* Add Razor directives to the top of the file to use Tag Helpers and the app's components in the *Shared* folder:

  ```cshtml
  @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
  @using {APPLICATION ASSEMBLY}.Shared
  ```

  Replace `{APPLICATION ASSEMBLY}` with the app's assembly name.

* Add a `<base>` tag and Blazor stylesheet `<link>` to the `<head>` content:

  ```cshtml
  <base href="~/" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
  ```

* Change the content of the `<body>` tag to the following:

  ```cshtml

## Scaffold Identity into a Blazor Server project with authorization

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/scaffold-identity/id-scaffold-dlg-auth.md)]

Some Identity options are configured in `Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs`. For more information, see [IHostingStartup](xref:fundamentals/configuration/platform-specific-configuration).

## Standalone or hosted Blazor WebAssembly apps

Client-side Blazor WebAssembly apps use their own Identity UI approaches and can't use ASP.NET Core Identity scaffolding. Server-side ASP.NET Core apps of hosted Blazor solutions can follow the Razor Pages/MVC guidance in this article and are configured just like any other type of ASP.NET Core app that supports Identity.

The Blazor framework doesn't include Razor component versions of Identity UI pages. Identity UI Razor components can be custom built or obtained from unsupported third-party sources.

For more information, see the [Blazor Security and Identity articles](xref:blazor/security/index).

## Create full Identity UI source
<!-- remove AllowAreas  #23280 -->
To maintain full control of the Identity UI, run the Identity scaffolder and select **Override all files**.

The following highlighted code shows the changes to replace the default Identity UI with Identity in an ASP.NET Core 2.1 web app. You might want to do this to have full control of the Identity UI.

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet1&highlight=13-14,17-999)]

The default Identity is replaced in the following code:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet2)]

The following code sets the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.LoginPath%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.LogoutPath%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.AccessDeniedPath%2A>):

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet3)]

Register an `IEmailSender` implementation, for example:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet4)]

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/StartupFull.cs?name=snippet)]

<!--
uld option: Use Local DB, not SQLite

dotnet new webapp -au Individual -uld -o RPauth
cd RPauth
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc RPauth.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.RegisterConfirmation"
-->

## Password configuration

If <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.PasswordOptions> are configured in `Startup.ConfigureServices`, [`[StringLength]` attribute](xref:System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLengthAttribute) configuration might be required for the `Password` property in scaffolded Identity pages. `InputModel` `Password` properties are found in the following files:

* `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs`
* `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ResetPassword.cshtml.cs`

## Disable a page

This sections show how to disable the register page but the approach can be used to disable any page.

To disable user registration:

* Scaffold Identity. Include Account.Register, Account.Login, and Account.RegisterConfirmation. For example:

  ```dotnetcli
   dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc RPauth.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.RegisterConfirmation"
  ```

* Update `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs` so users can't register from this endpoint:

  [!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/sample/Register.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

* Update `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml` to be consistent with the preceding changes:

  [!code-cshtml[](scaffold-identity/sample/Register.cshtml)]

* Comment out or remove the registration link from `Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Login.cshtml`

  ```cshtml
  @*
  <p>
      <a asp-page="./Register" asp-route-returnUrl="@Model.ReturnUrl">Register as a new user</a>
  </p>
  *@
  ```

* Update the *Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/RegisterConfirmation* page.

  * Remove the code and links from the cshtml file.
  * Remove the confirmation code from the `PageModel`:

  ```csharp
   [AllowAnonymous]
    public class RegisterConfirmationModel : PageModel
    {
        public IActionResult OnGet()
        {  
            return Page();
        }
    }
  ```
  
### Use another app to add users

Provide a mechanism to add users outside the web app. Options to add users include:

* A dedicated admin web app.
* A console app.

The following code outlines one approach to adding users:

* A list of users is read into memory.
* A strong unique password is generated for each user.
* The user is added to the Identity database.
* The user is notified and told to change the password.

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/consoleAddUser/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

The following code outlines adding a user:

[!code-csharp[](scaffold-identity/consoleAddUser/Data/SeedData.cs?name=snippet)]

A similar approach can be followed for production scenarios.

## Prevent publish of static Identity assets

To prevent publishing static Identity assets to the web root, see <xref:security/authentication/identity#prevent-publish-of-static-identity-assets>.
