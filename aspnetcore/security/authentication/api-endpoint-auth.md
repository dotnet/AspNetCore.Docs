# API endpoint authentication behavior in ASP.NET Core

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-10.0"

When using cookie authentication, API endpoints return the appropriate HTTP status codes (such as 401 or 403) for authentication failures instead of redirecting unauthenticated requests to login pages. This behavior, which is more suitable for programmatic API access, was introduced in ASP.NET Core in .NET 10.

## How ASP.NET Core identifies API endpoints

ASP.NET Core automatically applies this behavior to endpoints it recognizes as API-related, including:

- Controllers decorated with the `[ApiController]` attribute
- Minimal API endpoints registered with `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, `MapDelete`, etc.
- Endpoints that explicitly request JSON responses
- SignalR hubs and endpoints

## Default behavior and customization

By default, ASP.NET Core applies cookie authentication logic based on the endpoint type:

- **Web pages**: Redirect to login pages
- **API endpoints**: Return 401 or 403 status codes without redirects

## Configuring the behavior

While the default behavior works for most scenarios, it can be customized if needed:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie(options =>
    {
        options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login";
        // The framework automatically handles API endpoints
        // No additional configuration needed
    });
```

If you need to override the automatic detection for specific endpoints, use the `[Authorize]` attribute with specific authentication schemes or implement custom authentication handlers.

## Migration considerations

This behavior change introduced in .NET 10 is designed to be non-breaking for existing applications:

- **Web applications**: Continue to work as before with login page redirects
- **Mixed applications**: API endpoints get proper status codes while web pages get redirects
- **API-only applications**: Benefit from proper HTTP status codes without additional configuration

### Testing your API endpoints

After upgrading to ASP.NET Core 10, verify that your API endpoints return appropriate status codes:

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task UnauthorizedApiRequest_Returns401()
{
    var response = await client.GetAsync("/api/secure-data");
    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized, response.StatusCode);
    Assert.False(response.Headers.Location != null); // No redirect
}
```
