# Prerender and integrate ASP.NET Core Razor components

::: zone pivot="webassembly"

Integrating Razor components into Razor Pages and MVC apps in a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution is supported in ASP.NET Core in .NET 5 or later. Select a .NET 5 or later version of this article.

Razor components can be integrated into Razor Pages and MVC apps in a Blazor Server app. When the page or view is rendered, components can be prerendered at the same time.

After [configuring the project](#configuration), use the guidance in the following sections depending on the project's requirements:

* Routable components: For components that are directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when visitors should be able to make an HTTP request in their browser for a component with an [`@page`](xref:mvc/views/razor#page) directive.
  * [Use routable components in a Razor Pages app](#use-routable-components-in-a-razor-pages-app)
  * [Use routable components in an MVC app](#use-routable-components-in-an-mvc-app)
* [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view): For components that aren't directly routable from user requests. Follow this guidance when the app embeds components into existing pages and views with the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

## Configuration

An existing Razor Pages or MVC app can integrate Razor components into pages and views:

1. In the project's layout file:

   * Add the following `<base>` tag to the `<head>` element in `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```diff
     + <base href="~/" />
     ```

     The `href` value (the *app base path*) in the preceding example assumes that the app resides at the root URL path (`/`). If the app is a sub-application, follow the guidance in the *App base path* section of the <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/index#app-base-path> article.

   * Add a `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script immediately before the `Scripts` render section.

     `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` (MVC):

     ```diff
         ...
     +   <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>

         @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
     </body>
     ```

     The framework adds the `blazor.server.js` script to the app. There's no need to manually add a `blazor.server.js` script file to the app.

1. Add an imports file to the root folder of the project with the following content. Change the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder to the namespace of the project.

   `_Imports.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using System.Net.Http
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
   @using Microsoft.JSInterop
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}
   ```

1. Register the Blazor Server service in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.

   `Startup.cs`:

   ```diff
   + services.AddServerSideBlazor();
   ```

1. Add the Blazor Hub endpoint to the endpoints (`app.UseEndpoints`) of `Startup.Configure`.

   `Startup.cs`:

   ```diff
   + endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
   ```

1. Integrate components into any page or view. For example, add a `Counter` component to the project's `Shared` folder.

   `Pages/Shared/Counter.razor` (Razor Pages) or `Views/Shared/Counter.razor` (MVC):

   ```razor
   <h1>Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

   **Razor Pages**:

   In the project's `Index` page of a Razor Pages app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the page. When the `Index` page loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Pages/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Pages.Shared
   @model IndexModel
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
   }

   <div>
       <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </div>
   ```

   In the preceding example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the app's namespace.

   **MVC**:

   In the project's `Index` view of an MVC app, add the `Counter` component's namespace and embed the component into the view. When the `Index` view loads, the `Counter` component is prerendered in the page. In the following example, replace the `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder with the project's namespace.

   `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @using {APP NAMESPACE}.Views.Shared
   @{
       ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
   }

   <div>
       <component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </div>
   ```

For more information, see the [Render components from a page or view](#render-components-from-a-page-or-view) section.

## Use routable components in a Razor Pages app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in Razor Pages apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` page to the project with the following content.

   `Pages/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @page "/blazor"
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. In the `Startup.Configure` endpoints of `Startup.cs`, add a low-priority route for the `_Host` page as the last endpoint:

   ```diff
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       endpoints.MapRazorPages();
       endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
   +   endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
   });
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Use routable components in an MVC app

*This section pertains to adding components that are directly routable from user requests.*

To support routable Razor components in MVC apps:

1. Follow the guidance in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

1. Add an `App` component to the project root with the following content.

   `App.razor`:

   ```razor
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

   <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
       <Found Context="routeData">
           <RouteView RouteData="routeData" />
       </Found>
       <NotFound>
           <h1>Page not found</h1>
           <p>Sorry, but there's nothing here!</p>
       </NotFound>
   </Router>
   ```

1. Add a `_Host` view to the project with the following content.

   `Views/Home/_Host.cshtml`:

   ```cshtml
   @{
       Layout = "_Layout";
   }

   <app>
       <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
   </app>
   ```

   Components use the shared `_Layout.cshtml` file for their layout.

   <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configures whether the `App` component:

   * Is prerendered into the page.
   * Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

   For more information on the Component Tag Helper, including passing parameters and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode> configuration, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

1. Add an action to the Home controller.

   `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

   ```csharp
   public IActionResult Blazor()
   {
      return View("_Host");
   }
   ```

1. In the `Startup.Configure` endpoints of `Startup.cs`, add a low-priority route for the controller action that returns the `_Host` view:

   ```diff
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
           name: "default",
           pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
       endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
   +   endpoints.MapFallbackToController("Blazor", "Home");
   });
   ```

1. Add routable components to the project.

   `Pages/RoutableCounter.razor`:

   ```razor
   @page "/routable-counter"

   <h1>Routable Counter</h1>

   <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

   <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

   @code {
       private int currentCount = 0;

       private void IncrementCount()
       {
           currentCount++;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Run the project and navigate to the routable `RoutableCounter` component at `/routable-counter`.

For more information on namespaces, see the [Component namespaces](#component-namespaces) section.

## Render components from a page or view

*This section pertains to adding components to pages or views, where the components aren't directly routable from user requests.*

To render a component from a page or view, use the [Component Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper).

### Render stateful interactive components

Stateful interactive components can be added to a Razor page or view.

When the page or view renders:

* The component is prerendered with the page or view.
* The initial component state used for prerendering is lost.
* New component state is created when the SignalR connection is established.

The following Razor page renders a `Counter` component:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

### Render noninteractive components

In the following Razor page, the `Counter` component is statically rendered with an initial value that's specified using a form. Since the component is statically rendered, the component isn't interactive:

```cshtml
<h1>My Razor Page</h1>

<form>
    <input type="number" asp-for="InitialValue" />
    <button type="submit">Set initial value</button>
</form>

<component type="typeof(Counter)" render-mode="Static" 
    param-InitialValue="InitialValue" />

@functions {
    [BindProperty(SupportsGet=true)]
    public int InitialValue { get; set; }
}
```

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/component-tag-helper>.

## Component namespaces

When using a custom folder to hold the project's Razor components, add the namespace representing the folder to either the page/view or to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file. In the following example:

* Components are stored in the `Components` folder of the project.
* The `{APP NAMESPACE}` placeholder is the project's namespace. `Components` represents the name of the folder.

```cshtml
@using {APP NAMESPACE}.Components
```

The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is located in the `Pages` folder of a Razor Pages app or the `Views` folder of an MVC app.

For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/index#namespaces>.
