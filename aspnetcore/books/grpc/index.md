## Version

This guide has been written to cover the **.NET 6** version along with many additional updates related to the same "wave" of technologies (that is, Azure and additional third-party technologies) coinciding in time with the .NET 6 release.

## Who should use this guide

The audience for this guide is mainly developers, development leads, and architects who are interested in learning how to build ASP.NET Core gRPC applications.

A secondary audience is technical decision-makers who plan to choose whether to build their applications using gRPC.

## How you can use this guide

This guide begins by defining gRPC and introducing a reference application built using gRPC. Beyond these first two chapters, the rest of the book is broken up into specific chapters focused on topics common to most gRPC applications.

This guide is available both in PDF form and online. Feel free to forward this document or links to its online version to your team to help ensure common understanding of these topics. Most of these topics benefit from a consistent understanding of the underlying principles and patterns, as well as the trade-offs involved in decisions related to these topics. Our goal with this document is to equip teams and their leaders with the information they need to make well-informed decisions for their applications' architecture, development, and hosting.
