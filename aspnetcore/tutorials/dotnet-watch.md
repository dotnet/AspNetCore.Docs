# Develop ASP.NET Core apps using a file watcher

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT) and [Victor Hurdugaci](https://twitter.com/victorhurdugaci)

`dotnet watch` is a tool that runs a [.NET Core CLI](/dotnet/core/tools) command when source files change. For example, a file change can trigger compilation, test execution, or deployment.

This tutorial uses an existing web API with two endpoints: one that returns a sum and one that returns a product. The product method has a bug, which is fixed in this tutorial.

Download the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/tutorials/dotnet-watch/sample). It consists of two projects: *WebApp* (an ASP.NET Core web API) and *WebAppTests* (unit tests for the web API).

In a command shell, navigate to the *WebApp* folder. Run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `dotnet run --project <PROJECT>` to specify a project to run. For example, running `dotnet run --project WebApp` from the root of the sample app will also run the *WebApp* project.

The console output shows messages similar to the following (indicating that the app is running and awaiting requests):

```console
$ dotnet run
Hosting environment: Development
Content root path: C:/Docs/aspnetcore/tutorials/dotnet-watch/sample/WebApp
Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

In a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:<port number>/api/math/sum?a=4&b=5`. You should see the result of `9`.

Navigate to the product API (`http://localhost:<port number>/api/math/product?a=4&b=5`). It returns `9`, not `20` as you'd expect. That problem is fixed later in the tutorial.

## Add `dotnet watch` to a project

The `dotnet watch` file watcher tool is included with version 2.1.300 of the .NET Core SDK. The following steps are required when using an earlier version of the .NET Core SDK.

1. Add a `Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools` package reference to the `.csproj` file:

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
        <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

1. Install the `Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools` package by running the following command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet restore
    ```

## Run .NET Core CLI commands using `dotnet watch`

Any [.NET Core CLI command](/dotnet/core/tools#cli-commands) can be run with `dotnet watch`. For example:

| Command | Command with watch |
| ---- | ----- |
| dotnet run | dotnet watch run |
| dotnet run -f netcoreapp3.1 | dotnet watch run -f netcoreapp3.1 |
| dotnet run -f netcoreapp3.1 -- --arg1 | dotnet watch run -f netcoreapp3.1 -- --arg1 |
| dotnet test | dotnet watch test |

Run `dotnet watch run` in the *WebApp* folder. The console output indicates `watch` has started.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-5.0"
Running `dotnet watch run` on a web app launches a browser that navigates to the app's URL once ready. `dotnet watch` does this by reading the app's console output and waiting for the ready message displayed by <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost>.

`dotnet watch` refreshes the browser when it detects changes to watched files. To do this, the watch command injects a middleware to the app that modifies HTML responses created by the app. The middleware adds a JavaScript script block to the page that allows `dotnet watch` to instruct the browser to refresh. Currently, changes to all watched files, including static content such as `.html` and `.css` files cause the app to be rebuilt.

`dotnet watch`:

* Only watches files that impact builds by default.
* Any additionally watched files (via configuration) still results in a build taking place.

For more information on configuration, see [dotnet-watch configuration](#dotnet-watch-configuration) in this document.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `dotnet watch --project <PROJECT>` to specify a project to watch. For example, running `dotnet watch --project WebApp run` from the root of the sample app will also run and watch the *WebApp* project.

## Make changes with `dotnet watch`

Make sure `dotnet watch` is running.

Fix the bug in the `Product` method of `MathController.cs` so it returns the product and not the sum:

```csharp
public static int Product(int a, int b)
{
    return a * b;
}
```

Save the file. The console output indicates that `dotnet watch` detected a file change and restarted the app.

Verify `http://localhost:<port number>/api/math/product?a=4&b=5` returns the correct result.

## Run tests using `dotnet watch`

1. Change the `Product` method of `MathController.cs` back to returning the sum. Save the file.
1. In a command shell, navigate to the *WebAppTests* folder.
1. Run [dotnet restore](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore).
1. Run `dotnet watch test`. Its output indicates that a test failed and that the watcher is awaiting file changes:

     ```console
     Total tests: 2. Passed: 1. Failed: 1. Skipped: 0.
     Test Run Failed.
     ```

1. Fix the `Product` method code so it returns the product. Save the file.

`dotnet watch` detects the file change and reruns the tests. The console output indicates the tests passed.

## Customize files list to watch

By default, `dotnet-watch` tracks all files matching the following glob patterns:

* `**/*.cs`
* `*.csproj`
* `**/*.resx`
* Content files: `wwwroot/**`, `**/*.config`, `**/*.json`

More items can be added to the watch list by editing the `.csproj` file. Items can be specified individually or by using glob patterns.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- extends watching group to include *.js files -->
    <Watch Include="**\*.js" Exclude="node_modules\**\*;**\*.js.map;obj\**\*;bin\**\*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Opt-out of files to be watched

`dotnet-watch` can be configured to ignore its default settings. To ignore specific files, add the `Watch="false"` attribute to an item's definition in the `.csproj` file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- exclude Generated.cs from dotnet-watch -->
    <Compile Include="Generated.cs" Watch="false" />

    <!-- exclude Strings.resx from dotnet-watch -->
    <EmbeddedResource Include="Strings.resx" Watch="false" />

    <!-- exclude changes in this referenced project -->
    <ProjectReference Include="..\ClassLibrary1\ClassLibrary1.csproj" Watch="false" />
</ItemGroup>
```

```xml
<ItemGroup>
     <!-- Exclude all Content items from being watched. -->
    <Content Update="@(Content)" Watch="false" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Custom watch projects

`dotnet-watch` isn't restricted to C# projects. Custom watch projects can be created to handle different scenarios. Consider the following project layout:

* **test/**
  * `UnitTests/UnitTests.csproj`
  * `IntegrationTests/IntegrationTests.csproj`

If the goal is to watch both projects, create a custom project file configured to watch both projects:

```xml
<Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <TestProjects Include="**\*.csproj" />
        <Watch Include="**\*.cs" />
    </ItemGroup>

    <Target Name="Test">
        <MSBuild Targets="VSTest" Projects="@(TestProjects)" />
    </Target>

    <Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\Microsoft.Common.targets" />
</Project>
```

To start file watching on both projects, change to the *test* folder. Execute the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet watch msbuild /t:Test
```

VSTest executes when any file changes in either test project.

## dotnet-watch configuration

Some configuration options can be passed to `dotnet watch` through environment variables. The available variables are:

| Setting  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER`                | If set to "1" or "true", `dotnet watch` uses a polling file watcher instead of CoreFx's `FileSystemWatcher`. Used when watching files on network shares or Docker mounted volumes.                       |
| `DOTNET_WATCH_SUPPRESS_MSBUILD_INCREMENTALISM`   | By default, `dotnet watch` optimizes the build by avoiding certain operations such as running restore or re-evaluating the set of watched files on every file change. If set to "1" or "true",  these optimizations are disabled. |
| `DOTNET_WATCH_SUPPRESS_LAUNCH_BROWSER`   | `dotnet watch run` attempts to launch browsers for web apps with `launchBrowser` configured in `launchSettings.json`. If set to "1" or "true", this behavior is suppressed. |
| `DOTNET_WATCH_SUPPRESS_BROWSER_REFRESH`   | `dotnet watch run` attempts to refresh browsers when it detects file changes. If set to "1" or "true", this behavior is suppressed. This behavior is also suppressed if `DOTNET_WATCH_SUPPRESS_LAUNCH_BROWSER` is set. |

## Browser refresh

`dotnet watch` injects a script into the app that allows it to refresh the browser when the content changes. In some scenarios, such as when the app enables response compression, `dotnet watch` might ***not*** be able to inject the script. For such cases in development, manually inject the script into the app. For example, to configure the  web app to manually inject the script, update the layout file to include `_framework/aspnet-browser-refresh.js`:

```razor
@* _Layout.cshtml *@
<environment names="Development">
    <script src="/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js"></script>
</environment>
```

## Non-ASCII characters

Visual Studio 17.2 and later includes the .NET SDK 6.0.300 and later. With the .NET SDK and 6.0.300 later, `dotnet-watch` emits non-ASCII characters to the console during a hot reload session. On certain console hosts, such as the Windows conhost, these characters may appear garbled. To avoid garbled characters, consider one of the following approaches:

* Configure the `DOTNET_WATCH_SUPPRESS_EMOJIS=1` environment variable to suppress emitting these values.
* Switch to a different terminal, such as https://github.com/microsoft/terminal, that  supports rendering non-ASCII characters.
