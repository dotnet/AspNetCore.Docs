# Part 5, update the generated pages in an ASP.NET Core app

The scaffolded movie app has a good start, but the presentation isn't ideal. **ReleaseDate** should be two words, **Release Date**.

## Update the generated code

Update `Models/Movie.cs` with the following highlighted code:

[!code-csharp[Main](~/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie60/Models/MovieDateFixed.cs?name=snippet1&highlight=3,12,17)]

In the previous code:

* The `[Column(TypeName = "decimal(18, 2)")]` data annotation enables Entity Framework Core to correctly map `Price` to currency in the database. For more information, see [Data Types](/ef/core/modeling/relational/data-types).
* The [[Display]](xref:System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.DisplayAttribute) attribute specifies the display name of a field. In the preceding code, "Release Date" instead of "ReleaseDate".
* The [[DataType]](xref:System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.DataTypeAttribute) attribute specifies the type of the data (`Date`). The time information stored in the field isn't displayed.

[DataAnnotations](/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-6) is covered in the next tutorial.

Browse to *Pages/Movies* and hover over an **Edit** link to see the target URL.

![Browser window with mouse over the Edit link and a link Url of https://localhost:1234/Movies/Edit/5 is shown](~/tutorials/razor-pages/da1/edit7.png)

The **Edit**, **Details**, and **Delete** links are generated by the [Anchor Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/anchor-tag-helper) in the `Pages/Movies/Index.cshtml` file.

[!code-cshtml[](~/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start/snapshot_sample/RazorPagesMovie/Pages/Movies/Index.cshtml?highlight=16-18&range=32-)]

[Tag Helpers](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro) enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.

In the preceding code, the [Anchor Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/anchor-tag-helper) dynamically generates the HTML `href` attribute value from the Razor Page (the route is relative), the `asp-page`, and the route identifier (`asp-route-id`). For more information, see [URL generation for Pages](xref:razor-pages/index#url-generation-for-pages).

Use **View Source** from a browser to examine the generated markup. A portion of the generated HTML is shown below:

```html
<td>
  <a href="/Movies/Edit?id=1">Edit</a> |
  <a href="/Movies/Details?id=1">Details</a> |
  <a href="/Movies/Delete?id=1">Delete</a>
</td>
```

   The dynamically generated links pass the movie ID with a query string. For example, the `?id=1` in `https://localhost:5001/Movies/Details?id=1`.

### Add route template

Update the Edit, Details, and Delete Razor Pages to use the `{id:int}` route template. Change the page directive for each of these pages from `@page` to `@page "{id:int}"`. Run the app and then view source.

The generated HTML adds the ID to the path portion of the URL:

```html
<td>
  <a href="/Movies/Edit/1">Edit</a> |
  <a href="/Movies/Details/1">Details</a> |
  <a href="/Movies/Delete/1">Delete</a>
</td>
```

A request to the page with the `{id:int}` route template that does **not** include the integer will return an HTTP 404 (not found) error. For example, `https://localhost:5001/Movies/Details` will return a 404 error. To make the ID optional, append `?` to the route constraint:

```cshtml
@page "{id:int?}"
```

Test the behavior of `@page "{id:int?}"`:

1. Set the page directive in `Pages/Movies/Details.cshtml` to `@page "{id:int?}"`.
1. Set a break point in `public async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync(int? id)`, in `Pages/Movies/Details.cshtml.cs`.
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:5001/Movies/Details/`.

With the `@page "{id:int}"` directive, the break point is never hit. The routing engine returns HTTP 404. Using `@page "{id:int?}"`, the `OnGetAsync` method returns `NotFound` (HTTP 404):

[!code-csharp[](~/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie60/Pages/Movies/Details.cshtml.cs?name=snippet1&highlight=3-6)]

### Review concurrency exception handling

Review the `OnPostAsync` method in the `Pages/Movies/Edit.cshtml.cs` file:

[!code-csharp[](~/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start/snapshot_sample6/Pages/Movies/Edit.cshtml.cs?name=snippet1)]

The previous code detects concurrency exceptions when one client deletes the movie and the other client posts changes to the movie.

To test the `catch` block:

1. Set a breakpoint on `catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)`.
1. Select **Edit** for a movie, make changes, but don't enter **Save**.
1. In another browser window, select the **Delete** link for the same movie, and then delete the movie.
1. In the previous browser window, post changes to the movie.

Production code may want to detect concurrency conflicts. See [Handle concurrency conflicts](xref:data/ef-rp/concurrency) for more information.

### Posting and binding review

Examine the `Pages/Movies/Edit.cshtml.cs` file:

[!code-csharp[](~/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start/snapshot_sample6/Pages/Movies/Edit.cshtml.cs?name=snippet2)]

When an HTTP GET request is made to the Movies/Edit page, for example, `https://localhost:5001/Movies/Edit/3`:

* The `OnGetAsync` method fetches the movie from the database and returns the `Page` method.
* The `Page` method renders the `Pages/Movies/Edit.cshtml` Razor Page. The `Pages/Movies/Edit.cshtml` file contains the model directive `@model RazorPagesMovie.Pages.Movies.EditModel`, which makes the movie model available on the page.
* The Edit form is displayed with the values from the movie.

When the Movies/Edit page is posted:

* The form values on the page are bound to the `Movie` property. The `[BindProperty]` attribute enables [Model binding](xref:mvc/models/model-binding).

  ```csharp
  [BindProperty]
  public Movie Movie { get; set; }
  ```

* If there are errors in the model state, for example, `ReleaseDate` cannot be converted to a date, the form is redisplayed with the submitted values.
* If there are no model errors, the movie is saved.

The HTTP GET methods in the Index, Create, and Delete Razor pages follow a similar pattern. The HTTP POST `OnPostAsync` method in the Create Razor Page follows a similar pattern to the `OnPostAsync` method in the Edit Razor Page.
