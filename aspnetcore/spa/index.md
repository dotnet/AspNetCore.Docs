# Use the Single-Page Application templates (release candidate)

> [!NOTE]
> The released .NET Core 2.0.x SDK includes project templates for Angular, React, and React with Redux. **This documentation isn't about those released project templates.** This documentation is for the next version of the Angular, React, and React with Redux templates, which we hope to ship in early 2018.

## Prerequisites

* [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download), version 2.0.0 or later
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), version 6 or later

## Installation

Run the following command to install the **release candidate** of the ASP.NET Core templates for Angular, React, and React with Redux:

```console
dotnet new --install Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates::2.0.0-rc1-final
```

## Use the templates

- [Use the Angular project template](xref:spa/angular)
- [Use the React project template](xref:spa/react)
- [Use the React with Redux project template](xref:spa/react-with-redux)
