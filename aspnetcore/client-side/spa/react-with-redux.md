# Use the React-with-Redux project template with ASP.NET Core

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation isn't about the React-with-Redux project template included in ASP.NET Core 2.0. It's about the newer React-with-Redux template to which you can update manually. The template is included in ASP.NET Core 2.1 by default.

::: moniker-end

The updated React-with-Redux project template provides a convenient starting point for ASP.NET Core apps using React, Redux, and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA) conventions to implement a rich, client-side user interface (UI).

With the exception of the project creation command, all information about the React-with-Redux template is the same as the React template. To create this project type, run `dotnet new reactredux` instead of `dotnet new react`. For more information about the functionality common to both React-based templates, see [React template documentation](xref:spa/react).
