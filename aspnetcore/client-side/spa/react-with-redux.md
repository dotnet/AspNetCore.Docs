# Use the React-with-Redux project template with ASP.NET Core

The updated React-with-Redux project template provides a convenient starting point for ASP.NET Core apps using React, Redux, and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA) conventions to implement a rich, client-side user interface (UI).

With the exception of the project creation command, all information about the React-with-Redux template is the same as the React template. To create this project type, run `dotnet new reactredux` instead of `dotnet new react`. For more information about the functionality common to both React-based templates, see [React template documentation](xref:spa/react).

For information on configuring a React-with-Redux sub-application in IIS, see [ReactRedux Template 2.1: Unable to use SPA on IIS (aspnet/Templating &num;555)](https://github.com/aspnet/Templating/issues/555).
