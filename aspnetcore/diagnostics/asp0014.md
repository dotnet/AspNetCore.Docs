# ASP0014: Suggest using top level route registrations
| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |ASP0014|
| **Category** |Usage|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Routes can be registered directly at the top-level of a minimal API application.

## Rule description

Routes can be registered directly at the top-level of a minimal API application and don't need to be nested within a `UseEndpoints` call.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
});

app.Run();
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, register the endpoints directly on the `WebApplication`.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

## When to suppress warnings

Do ***not*** suppress a warning from this rule.
