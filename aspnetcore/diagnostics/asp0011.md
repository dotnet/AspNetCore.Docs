## Cause

`ConfigureLogging` isn't the recommended strategy for configuring logging in a Minimal API application.

## Rule description

`ConfigureLogging` isn't the recommended strategy for configuring logging in a Minimal API application.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Host.ConfigureLogging(logging =>
{
    logging.AddJsonConsole();
})

var app = builder.Build();

app.Run();
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use the `Logging` property on the `WebApplicationBuilder` to modify the logging configuration directly without the need for an additional `ConfigureLogging` call.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Logging.AddJsonConsole();

var app = builder.Build();

app.Run();
```

## When to suppress warnings

Do ***not*** suppress a warning from this rule.
