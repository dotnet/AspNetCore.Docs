# ASP0013: Suggest switching from using Configure methods to WebApplicationBuilder.Configuration

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |ASP0013|
| **Category** |Usage|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

`Configure` isn't the recommended strategy for reading and writing to configuration in a minimal API application.

## Rule description

`Configure` isn't the recommended strategy for configuring logging in a minimal API application.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Host.ConfigureAppConfiguration(builder =>
{
    builder.AddJsonFile("customAppSettings.json");
})

var app = builder.Build();

app.Run();
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use the `Configuration` property on the `WebApplicationBuilder` to modify application configuration directly without the need for an additional `ConfigureAppConfiguration` call.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("customAppSettings.json");

var app = builder.Build();

app.Run();
```

## When to suppress warnings

Do ***not*** suppress a warning from this rule.
