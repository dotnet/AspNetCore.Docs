## Cause

`IPv6Any` is preferred to `Any`, support IPv6 because `Any` is slower than `IPv6Any`. In some cases, `Any` may not work at all. `Any` has performance problems due to the [underlying System types implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/82404).

`127.0.0.1` is the IPv4 loopback address. `::1` is the IPv6 loopback address. `Any` is the wildcard address for both IPv4 and IPv6. `IPv6Any` is the wildcard address for IPv6 only.

Currently, when using  HTTP/1.x or HTTP/2.0:

* `localhost` resolve tos `[::1]`.
* `[::1]` isn't accepted by the server, which forces a retry using `127.0.0.1`, and the cycle continues.

Using `Any` with the preceding conditions is reported with a diagnostic message:

```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, ...);
})
```

## Rule description

The recommended way is to setup Kestrel to listen on `IPv6Any`.

## How to fix violations

For the reported code
```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, ...);
})
```

One can either explicitly change usage to `IPv6Any`:
```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.Listen(IPAddress.IPv6Any, ...);
})
```

or use another invocation - `options.ListenAnyIP()` without specifying any argument explicitly:
```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.ListenAnyIP(...);
})
```

## When to suppress warnings

The severity level of this diagnostic is Information. You can suppress warnings if your intention is to disable `IPv6` usage completely on the server. 

You can disable IPv6 either system-wide, or for .NET only via the [AppCtx switch or environment variable](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-6-networking-improvements/#an-option-to-globally-disable-ipv6)
