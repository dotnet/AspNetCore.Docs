## Cause

On the server machine that supports IPv6, listening to `Any`, rather than `IPv6Any` will either not work or be slower than necessary, because of the [underlying System types implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/82404).

At the moment of current article publishing, in case of HTTP/1.x or HTTP/2.0 a name like `localhost` will resolve to `[::1]`, which won't be accepted by the server, forcing a retry with `127.0.0.1` (i.e. failed attempt before each connection).

This usage will be reported with a diagnostic message:
```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, ...);
})
```

## Rule description

The recommended way is to setup Kestrel to listen on `IPv6Any`.

## How to fix violations

For the reported code
```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, ...);
})
```

One can either explicitly change usage to `IPv6Any`:
```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.Listen(IPAddress.IPv6Any, ...);
})
```

or use another invocation - `options.ListenAnyIP()` without specifying any argument explicitly:
```csharp
.UseKestrel().ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{ 
    options.ListenAnyIP(...);
})
```

## When to suppress warnings

The severity level of this diagnostic is Information. You can suppress warnings if your intention is to disable `IPv6` usage completely on the server. 

You can disable IPv6 either system-wide, or for .NET only via the [AppCtx switch or environment variable](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-6-networking-improvements/#an-option-to-globally-disable-ipv6)
