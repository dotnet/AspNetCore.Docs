# ASP0026: `[Authorize]` is overridden by `[AllowAnonymous]` from "farther away"

## Cause

It seems intuitive that an `[Authorize]` attribute placed "closer" to an MVC action than an `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute would override the `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute and force authorization. However, this is not necessarily the case. What does matter is the relative order of the attributes.

The following code shows examples where a closer `[Authorize]` attribute gets overridden by an `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute that is farther away.

```csharp
[AllowAnonymous]
public class MyController
{
    [Authorize] // Overridden by the [AllowAnonymous] attribute on the class
    public IActionResult Private() => null;
}
```

```csharp
[AllowAnonymous]
public class MyControllerAnon : ControllerBase
{
}

[Authorize] // Overridden by the [AllowAnonymous] attribute on MyControllerAnon
public class MyControllerInherited : MyControllerAnon
{
}

public class MyControllerInherited2 : MyControllerAnon
{
    [Authorize] // Overridden by the [AllowAnonymous] attribute on MyControllerAnon
    public IActionResult Private() => null;
}
```

```csharp
[AllowAnonymous]
[Authorize] // Overridden by the preceding [AllowAnonymous]
public class MyControllerMultiple : ControllerBase
{
}
```

## Rule description

Warning that an `[Authorize]` attribute is overridden by an `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute from "farther away."

## How to fix violations

The correct action to take if you see this warning depends on the intention behind the attributes. The farther away `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute should be removed if it's unintentionally exposing the endpoint to anonymous users. If the `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute was intended to override a closer `[Authorize]` attribute, you can repeat the `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute after the `[Authorize]` attribute to clarify the intent.

```csharp
[AllowAnonymous]
public class MyController
{
    // This produces no warning because the second, "closer" [AllowAnonymous]
    // clarifies that [Authorize] is intentionally overridden.
    // Specifying AuthenticationSchemes can still be useful
    // for endpoints that allow but don't require authenticated users.
    [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "Cookies")]
    [AllowAnonymous]
    public IActionResult Privacy() => null;
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

The severity level of this diagnostic is Information. You can suppress warnings if your intention is to override the `[Authorize]` attribute. However, we recommend that you make the intent clear by repeating the `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute after the `[Authorize]` attribute.
