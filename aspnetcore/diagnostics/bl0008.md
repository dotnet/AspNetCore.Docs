## Cause

A property has the [`[SupplyParameterFromForm]` attribute](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.SupplyParameterFromFormAttribute) and is initialized with a property initializer. 

## Rule description

The property can be overwritten with `null` when the component receives parameters, causing it to lose its initial value.

## How to fix violations

To ensure the initialized value isn't overwritten, move the initialization to one of the [`OnInitialized{Async}` lifecycle methods](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#component-initialization-oninitializedasync).

Consider the following Razor component that generates a BL0008 code analysis warning because the `Model` for the form is decorated with `[SupplyParameterFromForm]` and has a property initializer:

```razor
<EditForm Model="Model" OnSubmit="Submit" FormName="Starship1">
    ...
</EditForm>

@code {
    [SupplyParameterFromForm]
    private Starship Model { get; set; } = new();

    private void Submit()
    {
        ...
    }

    public class Starship
    {
        public string? Id { get; set; }
    }
}
```

To fix the violation, the initialization code for the `Model` property is moved to the [`OnInitialized` lifecycle method](xref:blazor/components/lifecycle#component-initialization-oninitializedasync), leaving the property as an [automatically implemented property (*auto property*)](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties). The following change also makes `Model` a [nullable reference types (NRT)](xref:migration/50-to-60#nullable-reference-types-nrts-and-net-compiler-null-state-static-analysis):

```csharp
[SupplyParameterFromForm]
private Starship? Model { get; set; }

protected override void OnInitialized() => Model ??= new();
```

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
