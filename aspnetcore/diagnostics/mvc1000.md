# MVC1000: Use of IHtmlHelper.Partial should be avoided

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |MVC1000|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.partial /> or <xref:microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.renderpartial /> method was called or referenced.

### Rule description

Rendering a partial using <c>IHtmlHelper.Partial</c> or <c>IHtmlHelper.RenderPartial</c> extension methods results in blocking calls. This may result in performance degradation and application dead locks issues due to thread pool starvation.

## How to fix violations

    - Use the <xref:microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.taghelpers.partialtaghelper />
    - Use the <xref:microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.partialasync /> or <xref:microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.renderpartialasync />

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this rule if updating the application to use the suggested fixes is non-trivial. Before the validation is disabled, be sure to consider the risks of thread pool starvation to the application.
