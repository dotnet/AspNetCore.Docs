# MVC1001: Filters cannot be applied to page handler methods

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |MVC1001|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An attribute implementing <xref:microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.filters.ifiltermetadata /> was applied to a Razor Page handler method.

### Rule description

Razor Page handler methods are selected after MVC filter exeuction has started, and consequently cannot contribute filters to execute. Applying a filter to a Razor Page handler is unsupported and always incorrect.

## How to fix violations

Remove the filter from the handler and apply it to a page. If a filter has to be applied to a specific handler, consider using multiple Razor Pages.

## When to suppress warnings

Don't suppress warnings from this rule.
