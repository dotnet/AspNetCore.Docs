# BL0005: Component parameter should not be set outside of its component

## Cause

A property on a type deriving from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase> annotated with [`[Parameter]`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ParameterAttribute) is being assigned to from outside the component.

## Rule description

Component parameters should be assigned to as part of the component initialization or as part of `SetParametersAsync`. Assigning a value to a parameter from an external source results in the value being overwritten the next time the component renders.

## How to fix violations

Consider using a distinct property to receive values from other components. Additional code can then be written to decide which of the two values to use in the component.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
