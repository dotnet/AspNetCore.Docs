# ASP0001: Authorization middleware is incorrectly configured

| **Category** |Usage|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An out of order call to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.AuthorizationAppBuilderExtensions.UseAuthorization%2A> was detected in the application start up code.

## Rule description

For authorization to be effective for endpoint routes, the call to `UseAuthorization` should appear between the calls to `UseRouting` and `UseEndpoints`. In the absence of this, the fallback policy, if configured, will be used to authorize all requests.

Consider the following code:

```csharp
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseRouting();
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
});
```

The call to `UseAuthorization` appears before `UseRouting` and consequently is not endpoint aware.

## How to fix violations

Change the order in which the call to `UseAuthorization` and `UseRouting` are performed.

```csharp
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
});
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress this rule if the call to `UseAuthorization` is intended to authorize the fallback policy on all outgoing requests, or is meant to authorize resources not routed using endpoint routing.
