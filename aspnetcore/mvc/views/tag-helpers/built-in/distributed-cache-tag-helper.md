# Distributed Cache Tag Helper in ASP.NET Core

By [Peter Kellner](https://peterkellner.net)

The Distributed Cache Tag Helper provides the ability to dramatically improve the performance of your ASP.NET Core app by caching its content to a distributed cache source.

For an overview of Tag Helpers, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro>.

The Distributed Cache Tag Helper inherits from the same base class as the Cache Tag Helper. All of the [Cache Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/cache-tag-helper) attributes are available to the Distributed Tag Helper.

The Distributed Cache Tag Helper uses [constructor injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection#constructor-injection-behavior). The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Distributed.IDistributedCache> interface is passed into the Distributed Cache Tag Helper's constructor. If no concrete implementation of `IDistributedCache` is created in `Startup.ConfigureServices` (`Startup.cs`), the Distributed Cache Tag Helper uses the same in-memory provider for storing cached data as the [Cache Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/cache-tag-helper).

## Distributed Cache Tag Helper Attributes

### Attributes shared with the Cache Tag Helper

* `enabled`
* `expires-on`
* `expires-after`
* `expires-sliding`
* `vary-by-header`
* `vary-by-query`
* `vary-by-route`
* `vary-by-cookie`
* `vary-by-user`
* `vary-by`
* `priority`

The Distributed Cache Tag Helper inherits from the same class as Cache Tag Helper. For descriptions of these attributes, see the [Cache Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/cache-tag-helper).

### name

| Attribute Type | Example                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| String         | `my-distributed-cache-unique-key-101` |

`name` is required. The `name` attribute is used as a key for each stored cache instance. Unlike the Cache Tag Helper that assigns a cache key to each instance based on the Razor page name and location in the Razor page, the Distributed Cache Tag Helper only bases its key on the attribute `name`.

Example:

```cshtml
<distributed-cache name="my-distributed-cache-unique-key-101">
    Time Inside Cache Tag Helper: @DateTime.Now
</distributed-cache>
```

## Distributed Cache Tag Helper IDistributedCache implementations

There are two implementations of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Distributed.IDistributedCache> built in to ASP.NET Core. One is based on SQL Server, and the other is based on Redis. Third-party implementations are also available, such as [NCache](http://www.alachisoft.com/ncache/aspnet-core-idistributedcache-ncache.html). Details of these implementations can be found at <xref:performance/caching/distributed>. Both implementations involve setting an instance of `IDistributedCache` in `Startup`.

There are no tag attributes specifically associated with using any specific implementation of `IDistributedCache`.
