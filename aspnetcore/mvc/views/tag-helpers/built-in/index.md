# ASP.NET Core built-in Tag Helpers

By [Peter Kellner](https://peterkellner.net)

For an overview of Tag Helpers, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro>.

There are built-in Tag Helpers which aren't listed in this document. The unlisted Tag Helpers are used internally by the [Razor](xref:mvc/views/razor) view engine. The Tag Helper for the `~` (tilde) character is unlisted. The tilde Tag Helper expands to the root path of the website.
