# Tag Helper Components in ASP.NET Core

By [Scott Addie](https://twitter.com/Scott_Addie) and [Fiyaz Bin Hasan](https://github.com/fiyazbinhasan)

A Tag Helper Component is a Tag Helper that allows you to conditionally modify or add HTML elements from server-side code. This feature is available in ASP.NET Core 2.0 or later.

ASP.NET Core includes two built-in Tag Helper Components: `head` and `body`. They're located in the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.TagHelpers> namespace and can be used in both MVC and Razor Pages. Tag Helper Components don't require registration with the app in `_ViewImports.cshtml`.

## Use cases

Two common use cases of Tag Helper Components include:

1. [Injecting a `<link>` into the `<head>`.](#inject-into-html-head-element)
1. [Injecting a `<script>` into the `<body>`.](#inject-into-html-body-element)

The following sections describe these use cases.

### Inject into HTML head element

Inside the HTML `<head>` element, CSS files are commonly imported with the HTML `<link>` element. The following code injects a `<link>` element into the `<head>` element using the `head` Tag Helper Component:

[!code-csharp[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/TagHelpers/AddressStyleTagHelperComponent.cs)]

In the preceding code:

* `AddressStyleTagHelperComponent` implements <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers.TagHelperComponent>. The abstraction:
  * Allows initialization of the class with a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers.TagHelperContext>.
  * Enables the use of Tag Helper Components to add or modify HTML elements.
* The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers.TagHelperComponent.Order*> property defines the order in which the Components are rendered. `Order` is necessary when there are multiple usages of Tag Helper Components in an app.
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers.TagHelperComponent.ProcessAsync*> compares the execution context's <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers.TagHelperContext.TagName*> property value to `head`. If the comparison evaluates to true, the content of the `_style` field is injected into the HTML `<head>` element.

### Inject into HTML body element

The `body` Tag Helper Component can inject a `<script>` element into the `<body>` element. The following code demonstrates this technique:

[!code-csharp[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/TagHelpers/AddressScriptTagHelperComponent.cs)]

A separate HTML file is used to store the `<script>` element. The HTML file makes the code cleaner and more maintainable. The preceding code reads the contents of `TagHelpers/Templates/AddressToolTipScript.html` and appends it with the Tag Helper output. The `AddressToolTipScript.html` file includes the following markup:

[!code-html[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/TagHelpers/Templates/AddressToolTipScript.html)]

The preceding code binds a [Bootstrap tooltip widget](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#tooltips) to any `<address>` element that includes a `printable` attribute. The effect is visible when a mouse pointer hovers over the element.

## Register a Component

A Tag Helper Component must be added to the app's Tag Helper Components collection. There are three ways to add to the collection:

* [Registration via services container](#registration-via-services-container)
* [Registration via Razor file](#registration-via-razor-file)
* [Registration via Page Model or controller](#registration-via-page-model-or-controller)

### Registration via services container

If the Tag Helper Component class isn't managed with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.TagHelpers.ITagHelperComponentManager>, it must be registered with the [dependency injection (DI)](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection) system. The following `Startup.ConfigureServices` code registers the `AddressStyleTagHelperComponent` and `AddressScriptTagHelperComponent` classes with a [transient lifetime](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection#lifetime-and-registration-options):

[!code-csharp[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_ConfigureServices&highlight=12-15)]

### Registration via Razor file

If the Tag Helper Component isn't registered with DI, it can be registered from a Razor Pages page or an MVC view. This technique is used for controlling the injected markup and the component execution order from a Razor file.

`ITagHelperComponentManager` is used to add Tag Helper Components or remove them from the app. The following code demonstrates this technique with `AddressTagHelperComponent`:

[!code-cshtml[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/Pages/Contact.cshtml?name=snippet_ITagHelperComponentManager)]

In the preceding code:

* The `@inject` directive provides an instance of `ITagHelperComponentManager`. The instance is assigned to a variable named `manager` for access downstream in the Razor file.
* An instance of `AddressTagHelperComponent` is added to the app's Tag Helper Components collection.

`AddressTagHelperComponent` is modified to accommodate a constructor that accepts the `markup` and `order` parameters:

[!code-csharp[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/TagHelpers/AddressTagHelperComponent.cs?name=snippet_Constructor)]

The provided `markup` parameter is used in `ProcessAsync` as follows:

[!code-csharp[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/TagHelpers/AddressTagHelperComponent.cs?name=snippet_ProcessAsync&highlight=10-11)]

### Registration via Page Model or controller

If the Tag Helper Component isn't registered with DI, it can be registered from a Razor Pages page model or an MVC controller. This technique is useful for separating C# logic from Razor files.

Constructor injection is used to access an instance of `ITagHelperComponentManager`. The Tag Helper Component is added to the instance's Tag Helper Components collection. The following Razor Pages page model demonstrates this technique with `AddressTagHelperComponent`:

[!code-csharp[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_IndexModelClass)]

In the preceding code:

* Constructor injection is used to access an instance of `ITagHelperComponentManager`.
* An instance of `AddressTagHelperComponent` is added to the app's Tag Helper Components collection.

## Create a Component

To create a custom Tag Helper Component:

* Create a public class deriving from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.TagHelpers.TagHelperComponentTagHelper>.
* Apply an [`[HtmlTargetElement]`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers.HtmlTargetElementAttribute) attribute to the class. Specify the name of the target HTML element.
* *Optional*: Apply an [`[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]`](xref:System.ComponentModel.EditorBrowsableAttribute) attribute to the class to suppress the type's display in IntelliSense.

The following code creates a custom Tag Helper Component that targets the `<address>` HTML element:

[!code-csharp[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/TagHelpers/AddressTagHelperComponentTagHelper.cs)]

Use the custom `address` Tag Helper Component to inject HTML markup as follows:

```csharp
public class AddressTagHelperComponent : TagHelperComponent
{
    private readonly string _printableButton =
        "<button type='button' class='btn btn-info' onclick=\"window.open(" +
        "'https://binged.it/2AXRRYw')\">" +
        "<span class='glyphicon glyphicon-road' aria-hidden='true'></span>" +
        "</button>";

    public override int Order => 3;

    public override async Task ProcessAsync(TagHelperContext context,
                                            TagHelperOutput output)
    {
        if (string.Equals(context.TagName, "address",
                StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) &&
            output.Attributes.ContainsName("printable"))
        {
            var content = await output.GetChildContentAsync();
            output.Content.SetHtmlContent(
                $"<div>{content.GetContent()}</div>{_printableButton}");
        }
    }
}
```

The preceding `ProcessAsync` method injects the HTML provided to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.TagHelpers.TagHelperContent.SetHtmlContent*> into the matching `<address>` element. The injection occurs when:

* The execution context's `TagName` property value equals `address`.
* The corresponding `<address>` element has a `printable` attribute.

For example, the `if` statement evaluates to true when processing the following `<address>` element:

[!code-cshtml[](th-components/samples/RazorPagesSample/Pages/Contact.cshtml?name=snippet_AddressPrintable)]
