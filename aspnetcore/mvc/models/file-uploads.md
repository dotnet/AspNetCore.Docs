# Upload files in ASP.NET Core

By [Steve Smith](https://ardalis.com/) and [Rutger Storm](https://github.com/rutix)

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-5.0"

ASP.NET Core supports uploading one or more files using buffered model binding for smaller files and unbuffered streaming for larger files.

[View or download sample code](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/) ([how to download](xref:index#how-to-download-a-sample))

## Security considerations

Use caution when providing users with the ability to upload files to a server. Attackers may attempt to:

* Execute [denial of service](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/denial-of-service) attacks.
* Upload viruses or malware.
* Compromise networks and servers in other ways.

Security steps that reduce the likelihood of a successful attack are:

* Upload files to a dedicated file upload area, preferably to a non-system drive. A dedicated location makes it easier to impose security restrictions on uploaded files. Disable execute permissions on the file upload location.&dagger;
* Do **not** persist uploaded files in the same directory tree as the app.&dagger;
* Use a safe file name determined by the app. Don't use a file name provided by the user or the untrusted file name of the uploaded file.&dagger; HTML encode the untrusted file name when displaying it. For example, logging the file name or displaying in UI (Razor automatically HTML encodes output).
* Allow only approved file extensions for the app's design specification.&dagger; <!-- * Check the file format signature to prevent a user from uploading a masqueraded file.&dagger; For example, don't permit a user to upload an *.exe* file with a *.txt* extension. Add this back when we get instructions how to do this.  -->
* Verify that client-side checks are performed on the server.&dagger; Client-side checks are easy to circumvent.
* Check the size of an uploaded file. Set a maximum size limit to prevent large uploads.&dagger;
* When files shouldn't be overwritten by an uploaded file with the same name, check the file name against the database or physical storage before uploading the file.
* **Run a virus/malware scanner on uploaded content before the file is stored.**

&dagger;The sample app demonstrates an approach that meets the criteria.

> [!WARNING]
> Uploading malicious code to a system is frequently the first step to executing code that can:
>
> * Completely gain control of a system.
> * Overload a system with the result that the system crashes.
> * Compromise user or system data.
> * Apply graffiti to a public UI.
>
> For information on reducing the attack surface area when accepting files from users, see the following resources:

For more information on implementing security measures, including examples from the sample app, see the [Validation](#validation) section.

## Storage scenarios

Common storage options for files include:

* Database

  * For small file uploads, a database is often faster than physical storage (file system or network share) options.
  * A database is often more convenient than physical storage options because retrieval of a database record for user data can concurrently supply the file content (for example, an avatar image).
  * A database is potentially less expensive than using a cloud data storage service.

* Physical storage (file system or network share)

  * For large file uploads:
    * Database limits may restrict the size of the upload.
    * Physical storage is often less economical than storage in a database.
  * Physical storage is potentially less expensive than using a cloud data storage service.
  * The app's process must have read and write permissions to the storage location. **Never grant execute permission.**

* Cloud data storage service, for example, [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/).

  * Services usually offer improved scalability and resiliency over on-premises solutions that are usually subject to single points of failure.
  * Services are potentially lower cost in large storage infrastructure scenarios.

  For more information, see [Quickstart: Use .NET to create a blob in object storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet).

## File upload scenarios

Two general approaches for uploading files are buffering and streaming.

**Buffering**

The entire file is read into an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>.  `IFormFile` is a C# representation of the file used to process or save the file.

The disk and memory used by file uploads depend on the number and size of concurrent file uploads. If an app attempts to buffer too many uploads, the site crashes when it runs out of memory or disk space. If the size or frequency of file uploads is exhausting app resources, use streaming.

Any single buffered file exceeding 64 KB is moved from memory to a temp file on disk.

Temporary files for larger requests are written to the location named in the `ASPNETCORE_TEMP` environment variable. If `ASPNETCORE_TEMP` is not defined, the files are written to the current user's temporary folder.

Buffering small files is covered in the following sections of this topic:

* [Physical storage](#upload-small-files-with-buffered-model-binding-to-physical-storage)
* [Database](#upload-small-files-with-buffered-model-binding-to-a-database)

**Streaming**

The file is received from a multipart request and directly processed or saved by the app. Streaming doesn't improve performance significantly. Streaming reduces the demands for memory or disk space when uploading files.

Streaming large files is covered in the [Upload large files with streaming](#upload-large-files-with-streaming) section.

### Upload small files with buffered model binding to physical storage

To upload small files, use a multipart form or construct a POST request using JavaScript.

The following example demonstrates the use of a Razor Pages form to upload a single file (`Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysical.cshtml` in the sample app):

```cshtml
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile" type="file">
            <span asp-validation-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></span>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <input asp-page-handler="Upload" class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>
```

The following example is analogous to the prior example except that:

* JavaScript's ([Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)) is used to submit the form's data.
* There's no validation.

```cshtml
<form action="BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysical/?handler=Upload" 
      enctype="multipart/form-data" onsubmit="AJAXSubmit(this);return false;" 
      method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label for="FileUpload_FormFile">File</label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input id="FileUpload_FormFile" type="file" 
                name="FileUpload.FormFile" />
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload" />

    <div style="margin-top:15px">
        <output name="result"></output>
    </div>
</form>

<script>
  async function AJAXSubmit (oFormElement) {
    var resultElement = oFormElement.elements.namedItem("result");
    const formData = new FormData(oFormElement);

    try {
    const response = await fetch(oFormElement.action, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      window.location.href = '/';
    }

    resultElement.value = 'Result: ' + response.status + ' ' + 
      response.statusText;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  }
</script>
```

To perform the form POST in JavaScript for clients that [don't support the Fetch API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch), use one of the following approaches:

* Use a Fetch Polyfill (for example, [window.fetch polyfill (github/fetch)](https://github.com/github/fetch)).
* Use `XMLHttpRequest`. For example:

  ```javascript
  <script>
    "use strict";

    function AJAXSubmit (oFormElement) {
      var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
      oReq.onload = function(e) { 
      oFormElement.elements.namedItem("result").value = 
        'Result: ' + this.status + ' ' + this.statusText;
      };
      oReq.open("post", oFormElement.action);
      oReq.send(new FormData(oFormElement));
    }
  </script>
  ```

In order to support file uploads, HTML forms must specify an encoding type (`enctype`) of `multipart/form-data`.

For a `files` input element to support uploading multiple files provide the `multiple` attribute on the `<input>` element:

```cshtml
<input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFiles" type="file" multiple>
```

The individual files uploaded to the server can be accessed through [Model Binding](xref:mvc/models/model-binding) using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>. The sample app demonstrates multiple buffered file uploads for database and physical storage scenarios.

<a name="filename"></a>

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** use the `FileName` property of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> other than for display and logging. When displaying or logging, HTML encode the file name. An attacker can provide a malicious filename, including full paths or relative paths. Applications should:
>
> * Remove the path from the user-supplied filename.
> * Save the HTML-encoded, path-removed filename for UI or logging.
> * Generate a new random filename for storage.
>
> The following code removes the path from the file name:
>
> ```csharp
> string untrustedFileName = Path.GetFileName(pathName);
> ```
>
> The examples provided thus far don't take into account security considerations. Additional information is provided by the following sections and the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/):
>
> * [Security considerations](#security-considerations)
> * [Validation](#validation)

When uploading files using model binding and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>, the action method can accept:

* A single <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>.
* Any of the following collections that represent several files:
  * <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFileCollection>
  * <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>\<<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>>
  * [List](xref:System.Collections.Generic.List`1)\<<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>>

> [!NOTE]
> Binding matches form files by name. For example, the HTML `name` value in `<input type="file" name="formFile">` must match the C# parameter/property bound (`FormFile`). For more information, see the [Match name attribute value to parameter name of POST method](#match-name-attribute-value-to-parameter-name-of-post-method) section.

The following example:

* Loops through one or more uploaded files.
* Uses [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) to return a full path for a file, including the file name. 
* Saves the files to the local file system using a file name generated by the app.
* Returns the total number and size of files uploaded.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync(List<IFormFile> files)
{
    long size = files.Sum(f => f.Length);

    foreach (var formFile in files)
    {
        if (formFile.Length > 0)
        {
            var filePath = Path.GetTempFileName();

            using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
            {
                await formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
            }
        }
    }

    // Process uploaded files
    // Don't rely on or trust the FileName property without validation.

    return Ok(new { count = files.Count, size });
}
```

Use `Path.GetRandomFileName` to generate a file name without a path. In the following example, the path is obtained from configuration:

```csharp
foreach (var formFile in files)
{
    if (formFile.Length > 0)
    {
        var filePath = Path.Combine(_config["StoredFilesPath"], 
            Path.GetRandomFileName());

        using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
        {
            await formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
        }
    }
}
```

The path passed to the <xref:System.IO.FileStream> *must* include the file name. If the file name isn't provided, an <xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException> is thrown at runtime.

Files uploaded using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> technique are buffered in memory or on disk on the server before processing. Inside the action method, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> contents are accessible as a <xref:System.IO.Stream>. In addition to the local file system, files can be saved to a network share or to a file storage service, such as [Azure Blob storage](/azure/visual-studio/vs-storage-aspnet5-getting-started-blobs).

For another example that loops over multiple files for upload and uses safe file names, see `Pages/BufferedMultipleFileUploadPhysical.cshtml.cs` in the sample app.

> [!WARNING]
> [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) throws an <xref:System.IO.IOException> if more than 65,535 files are created without deleting previous temporary files. The limit of 65,535 files is a per-server limit. For more information on this limit on Windows OS, see the remarks in the following topics:
>
> * [GetTempFileNameA function](/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettempfilenamea#remarks)
> * <xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*>

### Upload small files with buffered model binding to a database

To store binary file data in a database using [Entity Framework](/ef/core/index), define a <xref:System.Byte> array property on the entity:

```csharp
public class AppFile
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public byte[] Content { get; set; }
}
```

Specify a page model property for the class that includes an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>:

```csharp
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadDbModel : PageModel
{
    ...

    [BindProperty]
    public BufferedSingleFileUploadDb FileUpload { get; set; }

    ...
}

public class BufferedSingleFileUploadDb
{
    [Required]
    [Display(Name="File")]
    public IFormFile FormFile { get; set; }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> can be used directly as an action method parameter or as a bound model property. The prior example uses a bound model property.

The `FileUpload` is used in the Razor Pages form:

```cshtml
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile" type="file">
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <input asp-page-handler="Upload" class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
```

When the form is POSTed to the server, copy the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> to a stream and save it as a byte array in the database. In the following example, `_dbContext` stores the app's database context:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync()
{
    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        await FileUpload.FormFile.CopyToAsync(memoryStream);

        // Upload the file if less than 2 MB
        if (memoryStream.Length < 2097152)
        {
            var file = new AppFile()
            {
                Content = memoryStream.ToArray()
            };

            _dbContext.File.Add(file);

            await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        }
        else
        {
            ModelState.AddModelError("File", "The file is too large.");
        }
    }

    return Page();
}
```

The preceding example is similar to a scenario demonstrated in the sample app:

* `Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadDb.cshtml`
* `Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadDb.cshtml.cs`

> [!WARNING]
> Use caution when storing binary data in relational databases, as it can adversely impact performance.
>
> Don't rely on or trust the `FileName` property of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> without validation. The `FileName` property should only be used for display purposes and only after HTML encoding.
>
> The examples provided don't take into account security considerations. Additional information is provided by the following sections and the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/):

### Upload large files with streaming

The [3.1 example](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Pages/StreamedSingleFileUploadDb.cshtml) demonstrates how to use JavaScript to stream a file to a controller action. The file's antiforgery token is generated using a custom filter attribute and passed to the client HTTP headers instead of in the request body. Because the action method processes the uploaded data directly, form model binding is disabled by another custom filter. Within the action, the form's contents are read using a `MultipartReader`, which reads each individual `MultipartSection`, processing the file or storing the contents as appropriate. After the multipart sections are read, the action performs its own model binding.

The initial page response loads the form and saves an antiforgery token in a cookie (via the `GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute` attribute). The attribute uses ASP.NET Core's built-in [antiforgery support](xref:security/anti-request-forgery) to set a cookie with a request token:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Filters/Antiforgery.cs?name=snippet_GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute)]

The `DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute` is used to disable model binding:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Filters/ModelBinding.cs?name=snippet_DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute)]

In the sample app, `GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute` and `DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute` are applied as filters to the page application models of `/StreamedSingleFileUploadDb` and `/StreamedSingleFileUploadPhysical` in `Startup.ConfigureServices` using [Razor Pages conventions](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions):

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddRazorPages&highlight=7-10,16-19)]

Since model binding doesn't read the form, parameters that are bound from the form don't bind (query, route, and header continue to work). The action method works directly with the `Request` property. A `MultipartReader` is used to read each section. Key/value data is stored in a `KeyValueAccumulator`. After the multipart sections are read, the contents of the `KeyValueAccumulator` are used to bind the form data to a model type.

The complete `StreamingController.UploadDatabase` method for streaming to a database with EF Core:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Controllers/StreamingController.cs?name=snippet_UploadDatabase)]

`MultipartRequestHelper` (`Utilities/MultipartRequestHelper.cs`):

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Utilities/MultipartRequestHelper.cs)]

The complete `StreamingController.UploadPhysical` method for streaming to a physical location:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Controllers/StreamingController.cs?name=snippet_UploadPhysical)]

In the sample app, validation checks are handled by `FileHelpers.ProcessStreamedFile`.

## Validation

The sample app's `FileHelpers` class demonstrates several checks for buffered <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> and streamed file uploads. For processing <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> buffered file uploads in the sample app, see the `ProcessFormFile` method in the `Utilities/FileHelpers.cs` file. For processing streamed files, see the `ProcessStreamedFile` method in the same file.

> [!WARNING]
> The validation processing methods demonstrated in the sample app don't scan the content of uploaded files. In most production scenarios, a virus/malware scanner API is used on the file before making the file available to users or other systems.
>
> Although the topic sample provides a working example of validation techniques, don't implement the `FileHelpers` class in a production app unless you:
>
> * Fully understand the implementation.
> * Modify the implementation as appropriate for the app's environment and specifications.
>
> **Never indiscriminately implement security code in an app without addressing these requirements.**

### Content validation

**Use a third party virus/malware scanning API on uploaded content.**

Scanning files is demanding on server resources in high volume scenarios. If request processing performance is diminished due to file scanning, consider offloading the scanning work to a [background service](xref:fundamentals/host/hosted-services), possibly a service running on a server different from the app's server. Typically, uploaded files are held in a quarantined area until the background virus scanner checks them. When a file passes, the file is moved to the normal file storage location. These steps are usually performed in conjunction with a database record that indicates the scanning status of a file. By using such an approach, the app and app server remain focused on responding to requests.

### File extension validation

The uploaded file's extension should be checked against a list of permitted extensions. For example:

```csharp
private string[] permittedExtensions = { ".txt", ".pdf" };

var ext = Path.GetExtension(uploadedFileName).ToLowerInvariant();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(ext) || !permittedExtensions.Contains(ext))
{
    // The extension is invalid ... discontinue processing the file
}
```

### File signature validation

A file's signature is determined by the first few bytes at the start of a file. These bytes can be used to indicate if the extension matches the content of the file. The sample app checks file signatures for a few common file types. In the following example, the file signature for a JPEG image is checked against the file:

```csharp
private static readonly Dictionary<string, List<byte[]>> _fileSignature = 
    new Dictionary<string, List<byte[]>>
{
    { ".jpeg", new List<byte[]>
        {
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0 },
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE2 },
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE3 },
        }
    },
};

using (var reader = new BinaryReader(uploadedFileData))
{
    var signatures = _fileSignature[ext];
    var headerBytes = reader.ReadBytes(signatures.Max(m => m.Length));
    
    return signatures.Any(signature => 
        headerBytes.Take(signature.Length).SequenceEqual(signature));
}
```

To obtain additional file signatures, see the [File Signatures Database](https://www.filesignatures.net/) and official file specifications.

### File name security

Never use a client-supplied file name for saving a file to physical storage. Create a safe file name for the file using [Path.GetRandomFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetRandomFileName*) or [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) to create a full path (including the file name) for temporary storage.

Razor automatically HTML encodes property values for display. The following code is safe to use:

```cshtml
@foreach (var file in Model.DatabaseFiles) {
    <tr>
        <td>
            @file.UntrustedName
        </td>
    </tr>
}
```

Outside of Razor, always <xref:System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode*> file name content from a user's request.

Many implementations must include a check that the file exists; otherwise, the file is overwritten by a file of the same name. Supply additional logic to meet your app's specifications.

### Size validation

Limit the size of uploaded files.

In the sample app, the size of the file is limited to 2 MB (indicated in bytes). The limit is supplied via [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) from the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "FileSizeLimit": 2097152
}
```

The `FileSizeLimit` is injected into `PageModel` classes:

```csharp
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly long _fileSizeLimit;

    public BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel(IConfiguration config)
    {
        _fileSizeLimit = config.GetValue<long>("FileSizeLimit");
    }

    ...
}
```

When a file size exceeds the limit, the file is rejected:

```csharp
if (formFile.Length > _fileSizeLimit)
{
    // The file is too large ... discontinue processing the file
}
```

### Match name attribute value to parameter name of POST method

In non-Razor forms that POST form data or use JavaScript's `FormData` directly, the name specified in the form's element or `FormData` must match the name of the parameter in the controller's action.

In the following example:

* When using an `<input>` element, the `name` attribute is set to the value `battlePlans`:

  ```html
  <input type="file" name="battlePlans" multiple>
  ```

* When using `FormData` in JavaScript, the name is set to the value `battlePlans`:

  ```javascript
  var formData = new FormData();

  for (var file in files) {
    formData.append("battlePlans", file, file.name);
  }
  ```

Use a matching name for the parameter of the C# method (`battlePlans`):

* For a Razor Pages page handler method named `Upload`:

  ```csharp
  public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync(List<IFormFile> battlePlans)
  ```

* For an MVC POST controller action method:

  ```csharp
  public async Task<IActionResult> Post(List<IFormFile> battlePlans)
  ```

## Server and app configuration

### Multipart body length limit

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> sets the limit for the length of each multipart body. Form sections that exceed this limit throw an <xref:System.IO.InvalidDataException> when parsed. The default is 134,217,728 (128 MB). Customize the limit using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> setting in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.Configure<FormOptions>(options =>
    {
        // Set the limit to 256 MB
        options.MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456;
    });
}
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequestFormLimitsAttribute> is used to set the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> for a single page or action.

In a Razor Pages app, apply the filter with a [convention](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions) in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddRazorPages(options =>
{
    options.Conventions
        .AddPageApplicationModelConvention("/FileUploadPage",
            model.Filters.Add(
                new RequestFormLimitsAttribute()
                {
                    // Set the limit to 256 MB
                    MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456
                });
});
```

In a Razor Pages app or an MVC app, apply the filter to the page model or action method:

```csharp
// Set the limit to 256 MB
[RequestFormLimits(MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456)]
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    ...
}
```

### Kestrel maximum request body size

For apps hosted by Kestrel, the default maximum request body size is 30,000,000 bytes, which is approximately 28.6 MB. Customize the limit using the [MaxRequestBodySize](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options#maximum-request-body-size) Kestrel server option:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.ConfigureKestrel((context, options) =>
            {
                // Handle requests up to 50 MB
                options.Limits.MaxRequestBodySize = 52428800;
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequestSizeLimitAttribute> is used to set the [MaxRequestBodySize](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options#maximum-request-body-size) for a single page or action.

In a Razor Pages app, apply the filter with a [convention](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions) in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddRazorPages(options =>
{
    options.Conventions
        .AddPageApplicationModelConvention("/FileUploadPage",
            model =>
            {
                // Handle requests up to 50 MB
                model.Filters.Add(
                    new RequestSizeLimitAttribute(52428800));
            });
});
```

In a Razor pages app or an MVC app, apply the filter to the page handler class or action method:

```csharp
// Handle requests up to 50 MB
[RequestSizeLimit(52428800)]
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    ...
}
```

The `RequestSizeLimitAttribute` can also be applied using the [`@attribute`](xref:mvc/views/razor#attribute) Razor directive:

```cshtml
@attribute [RequestSizeLimitAttribute(52428800)]
```

### Other Kestrel limits

Other Kestrel limits may apply for apps hosted by Kestrel:

* [Maximum client connections](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options#maximum-client-connections)
* [Request and response data rates](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options#minimum-request-body-data-rate)

### IIS

The default request limit (`maxAllowedContentLength`) is 30,000,000 bytes, which is approximately 28.6 MB. Customize the limit in the `web.config` file. In the following example, the limit is set to 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes):

```xml
<system.webServer>
  <security>
    <requestFiltering>
      <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="52428800" />
    </requestFiltering>
  </security>
</system.webServer>
```

The `maxAllowedContentLength` setting only applies to IIS. For more information, see [Request Limits `<requestLimits>`](/iis/configuration/system.webServer/security/requestFiltering/requestLimits/).

## Troubleshoot

Below are some common problems encountered when working with uploading files and their possible solutions.

### Not Found error when deployed to an IIS server

The following error indicates that the uploaded file exceeds the server's configured content length:

```
HTTP 404.13 - Not Found
The request filtering module is configured to deny a request that exceeds the request content length.
```

For more information, see the [IIS](#iis) section.

### Connection failure

A connection error and a reset server connection probably indicates that the uploaded file exceeds Kestrel's maximum request body size. For more information, see the [Kestrel maximum request body size](#kestrel-maximum-request-body-size) section. Kestrel client connection limits may also require adjustment.

### Null Reference Exception with IFormFile

If the controller is accepting uploaded files using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> but the value is `null`, confirm that the HTML form is specifying an `enctype` value of `multipart/form-data`. If this attribute isn't set on the `<form>` element, the file upload doesn't occur and any bound <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> arguments are `null`. Also confirm that the [upload naming in form data matches the app's naming](#match-name-attribute-value-to-parameter-name-of-post-method).

### Stream was too long

The examples in this topic rely upon <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> to hold the uploaded file's content. The size limit of a `MemoryStream` is `int.MaxValue`. If the app's file upload scenario requires holding file content larger than 50 MB, use an alternative approach that doesn't rely upon a single `MemoryStream` for holding an uploaded file's content.

ASP.NET Core supports uploading one or more files using buffered model binding for smaller files and unbuffered streaming for larger files.

## Security considerations

Use caution when providing users with the ability to upload files to a server. Attackers may attempt to:

* Execute [denial of service](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/denial-of-service) attacks.
* Upload viruses or malware.
* Compromise networks and servers in other ways.

Security steps that reduce the likelihood of a successful attack are:

* Upload files to a dedicated file upload area, preferably to a non-system drive. A dedicated location makes it easier to impose security restrictions on uploaded files. Disable execute permissions on the file upload location.&dagger;
* Do **not** persist uploaded files in the same directory tree as the app.&dagger;
* Use a safe file name determined by the app. Don't use a file name provided by the user or the untrusted file name of the uploaded file.&dagger; HTML encode the untrusted file name when displaying it. For example, logging the file name or displaying in UI (Razor automatically HTML encodes output).
* Allow only approved file extensions for the app's design specification.&dagger; <!-- * Check the file format signature to prevent a user from uploading a masqueraded file.&dagger; For example, don't permit a user to upload an *.exe* file with a *.txt* extension. Add this back when we get instructions how to do this.  -->
* Verify that client-side checks are performed on the server.&dagger; Client-side checks are easy to circumvent.
* Check the size of an uploaded file. Set a maximum size limit to prevent large uploads.&dagger;
* When files shouldn't be overwritten by an uploaded file with the same name, check the file name against the database or physical storage before uploading the file.
* **Run a virus/malware scanner on uploaded content before the file is stored.**

&dagger;The sample app demonstrates an approach that meets the criteria.

> [!WARNING]
> Uploading malicious code to a system is frequently the first step to executing code that can:
>
> * Completely gain control of a system.
> * Overload a system with the result that the system crashes.
> * Compromise user or system data.
> * Apply graffiti to a public UI.
>
> For information on reducing the attack surface area when accepting files from users, see the following resources:
>
> * [Unrestricted File Upload](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)
> * [Azure Security: Ensure appropriate controls are in place when accepting files from users](/azure/security/azure-security-threat-modeling-tool-input-validation#controls-users)

For more information on implementing security measures, including examples from the sample app, see the [Validation](#validation) section.

## Storage scenarios

Common storage options for files include:

* Database

  * For small file uploads, a database is often faster than physical storage (file system or network share) options.
  * A database is often more convenient than physical storage options because retrieval of a database record for user data can concurrently supply the file content (for example, an avatar image).
  * A database is potentially less expensive than using a data storage service.

* Physical storage (file system or network share)

  * For large file uploads:
    * Database limits may restrict the size of the upload.
    * Physical storage is often less economical than storage in a database.
  * Physical storage is potentially less expensive than using a data storage service.
  * The app's process must have read and write permissions to the storage location. **Never grant execute permission.**

* Data storage service (for example, [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/))

  * Services usually offer improved scalability and resiliency over on-premises solutions that are usually subject to single points of failure.
  * Services are potentially lower cost in large storage infrastructure scenarios.

  For more information, see [Quickstart: Use .NET to create a blob in object storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet).

## File upload scenarios

Two general approaches for uploading files are buffering and streaming.

**Buffering**

The entire file is read into an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>, which is a C# representation of the file used to process or save the file.

The resources (disk, memory) used by file uploads depend on the number and size of concurrent file uploads. If an app attempts to buffer too many uploads, the site crashes when it runs out of memory or disk space. If the size or frequency of file uploads is exhausting app resources, use streaming.

> [!NOTE]
> Any single buffered file exceeding 64 KB is moved from memory to a temp file on disk.

Buffering small files is covered in the following sections of this topic:

* [Physical storage](#upload-small-files-with-buffered-model-binding-to-physical-storage)
* [Database](#upload-small-files-with-buffered-model-binding-to-a-database)

**Streaming**

The file is received from a multipart request and directly processed or saved by the app. Streaming doesn't improve performance significantly. Streaming reduces the demands for memory or disk space when uploading files.

Streaming large files is covered in the [Upload large files with streaming](#upload-large-files-with-streaming) section.

### Upload small files with buffered model binding to physical storage

To upload small files, use a multipart form or construct a POST request using JavaScript.

The following example demonstrates the use of a Razor Pages form to upload a single file (`Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysical.cshtml` in the sample app):

```cshtml
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile" type="file">
            <span asp-validation-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></span>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <input asp-page-handler="Upload" class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>
```

The following example is analogous to the prior example except that:

* JavaScript's ([Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)) is used to submit the form's data.
* There's no validation.

```cshtml
<form action="BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysical/?handler=Upload" 
      enctype="multipart/form-data" onsubmit="AJAXSubmit(this);return false;" 
      method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label for="FileUpload_FormFile">File</label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input id="FileUpload_FormFile" type="file" 
                name="FileUpload.FormFile" />
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload" />

    <div style="margin-top:15px">
        <output name="result"></output>
    </div>
</form>

<script>
  async function AJAXSubmit (oFormElement) {
    var resultElement = oFormElement.elements.namedItem("result");
    const formData = new FormData(oFormElement);

    try {
    const response = await fetch(oFormElement.action, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      window.location.href = '/';
    }

    resultElement.value = 'Result: ' + response.status + ' ' + 
      response.statusText;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  }
</script>
```

To perform the form POST in JavaScript for clients that [don't support the Fetch API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch), use one of the following approaches:

* Use a Fetch Polyfill (for example, [window.fetch polyfill (github/fetch)](https://github.com/github/fetch)).
* Use `XMLHttpRequest`. For example:

  ```javascript
  <script>
    "use strict";

    function AJAXSubmit (oFormElement) {
      var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
      oReq.onload = function(e) { 
      oFormElement.elements.namedItem("result").value = 
        'Result: ' + this.status + ' ' + this.statusText;
      };
      oReq.open("post", oFormElement.action);
      oReq.send(new FormData(oFormElement));
    }
  </script>
  ```

In order to support file uploads, HTML forms must specify an encoding type (`enctype`) of `multipart/form-data`.

For a `files` input element to support uploading multiple files provide the `multiple` attribute on the `<input>` element:

```cshtml
<input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFiles" type="file" multiple>
```

The individual files uploaded to the server can be accessed through [Model Binding](xref:mvc/models/model-binding) using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>. The sample app demonstrates multiple buffered file uploads for database and physical storage scenarios.

<a name="filename"></a>

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** use the `FileName` property of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> other than for display and logging. When displaying or logging, HTML encode the file name. An attacker can provide a malicious filename, including full paths or relative paths. Applications should:
>
> * Remove the path from the user-supplied filename.
> * Save the HTML-encoded, path-removed filename for UI or logging.
> * Generate a new random filename for storage.
>
> The following code removes the path from the file name:
>
> ```csharp
> string untrustedFileName = Path.GetFileName(pathName);
> ```
>
> The examples provided thus far don't take into account security considerations. Additional information is provided by the following sections and the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/):
>
> * [Security considerations](#security-considerations)
> * [Validation](#validation)

When uploading files using model binding and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>, the action method can accept:

* A single <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>.
* Any of the following collections that represent several files:
  * <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFileCollection>
  * <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>\<<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>>
  * [List](xref:System.Collections.Generic.List`1)\<<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>>

> [!NOTE]
> Binding matches form files by name. For example, the HTML `name` value in `<input type="file" name="formFile">` must match the C# parameter/property bound (`FormFile`). For more information, see the [Match name attribute value to parameter name of POST method](#match-name-attribute-value-to-parameter-name-of-post-method) section.

The following example:

* Loops through one or more uploaded files.
* Uses [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) to return a full path for a file, including the file name. 
* Saves the files to the local file system using a file name generated by the app.
* Returns the total number and size of files uploaded.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync(List<IFormFile> files)
{
    long size = files.Sum(f => f.Length);

    foreach (var formFile in files)
    {
        if (formFile.Length > 0)
        {
            var filePath = Path.GetTempFileName();

            using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
            {
                await formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
            }
        }
    }

    // Process uploaded files
    // Don't rely on or trust the FileName property without validation.

    return Ok(new { count = files.Count, size });
}
```

Use `Path.GetRandomFileName` to generate a file name without a path. In the following example, the path is obtained from configuration:

```csharp
foreach (var formFile in files)
{
    if (formFile.Length > 0)
    {
        var filePath = Path.Combine(_config["StoredFilesPath"], 
            Path.GetRandomFileName());

        using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
        {
            await formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
        }
    }
}
```

The path passed to the <xref:System.IO.FileStream> *must* include the file name. If the file name isn't provided, an <xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException> is thrown at runtime.

Files uploaded using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> technique are buffered in memory or on disk on the server before processing. Inside the action method, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> contents are accessible as a <xref:System.IO.Stream>. In addition to the local file system, files can be saved to a network share or to a file storage service, such as [Azure Blob storage](/azure/visual-studio/vs-storage-aspnet5-getting-started-blobs).

For another example that loops over multiple files for upload and uses safe file names, see `Pages/BufferedMultipleFileUploadPhysical.cshtml.cs` in the sample app.

> [!WARNING]
> [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) throws an <xref:System.IO.IOException> if more than 65,535 files are created without deleting previous temporary files. The limit of 65,535 files is a per-server limit. For more information on this limit on Windows OS, see the remarks in the following topics:
>
> * [GetTempFileNameA function](/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettempfilenamea#remarks)
> * <xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*>

### Upload small files with buffered model binding to a database

To store binary file data in a database using [Entity Framework](/ef/core/index), define a <xref:System.Byte> array property on the entity:

```csharp
public class AppFile
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public byte[] Content { get; set; }
}
```

Specify a page model property for the class that includes an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>:

```csharp
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadDbModel : PageModel
{
    ...

    [BindProperty]
    public BufferedSingleFileUploadDb FileUpload { get; set; }

    ...
}

public class BufferedSingleFileUploadDb
{
    [Required]
    [Display(Name="File")]
    public IFormFile FormFile { get; set; }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> can be used directly as an action method parameter or as a bound model property. The prior example uses a bound model property.

The `FileUpload` is used in the Razor Pages form:

```cshtml
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile" type="file">
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <input asp-page-handler="Upload" class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
```

When the form is POSTed to the server, copy the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> to a stream and save it as a byte array in the database. In the following example, `_dbContext` stores the app's database context:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync()
{
    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        await FileUpload.FormFile.CopyToAsync(memoryStream);

        // Upload the file if less than 2 MB
        if (memoryStream.Length < 2097152)
        {
            var file = new AppFile()
            {
                Content = memoryStream.ToArray()
            };

            _dbContext.File.Add(file);

            await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        }
        else
        {
            ModelState.AddModelError("File", "The file is too large.");
        }
    }

    return Page();
}
```

The preceding example is similar to a scenario demonstrated in the sample app:

* `Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadDb.cshtml`
* `Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadDb.cshtml.cs`

> [!WARNING]
> Use caution when storing binary data in relational databases, as it can adversely impact performance.
>
> Don't rely on or trust the `FileName` property of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> without validation. The `FileName` property should only be used for display purposes and only after HTML encoding.
>

### Upload large files with streaming

The following example demonstrates how to use JavaScript to stream a file to a controller action. The file's antiforgery token is generated using a custom filter attribute and passed to the client HTTP headers instead of in the request body. Because the action method processes the uploaded data directly, form model binding is disabled by another custom filter. Within the action, the form's contents are read using a `MultipartReader`, which reads each individual `MultipartSection`, processing the file or storing the contents as appropriate. After the multipart sections are read, the action performs its own model binding.

The initial page response loads the form and saves an antiforgery token in a cookie (via the `GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute` attribute). The attribute uses ASP.NET Core's built-in [antiforgery support](xref:security/anti-request-forgery) to set a cookie with a request token:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Filters/Antiforgery.cs?name=snippet_GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute)]

The `DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute` is used to disable model binding:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Filters/ModelBinding.cs?name=snippet_DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute)]

In the sample app, `GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute` and `DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute` are applied as filters to the page application models of `/StreamedSingleFileUploadDb` and `/StreamedSingleFileUploadPhysical` in `Startup.ConfigureServices` using [Razor Pages conventions](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions):

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddRazorPages&highlight=7-10,16-19)]

Since model binding doesn't read the form, parameters that are bound from the form don't bind (query, route, and header continue to work). The action method works directly with the `Request` property. A `MultipartReader` is used to read each section. Key/value data is stored in a `KeyValueAccumulator`. After the multipart sections are read, the contents of the `KeyValueAccumulator` are used to bind the form data to a model type.

The complete `StreamingController.UploadDatabase` method for streaming to a database with EF Core:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Controllers/StreamingController.cs?name=snippet_UploadDatabase)]

`MultipartRequestHelper` (`Utilities/MultipartRequestHelper.cs`):

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Utilities/MultipartRequestHelper.cs)]

The complete `StreamingController.UploadPhysical` method for streaming to a physical location:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/3.x/SampleApp/Controllers/StreamingController.cs?name=snippet_UploadPhysical)]

In the sample app, validation checks are handled by `FileHelpers.ProcessStreamedFile`.

## Validation

The sample app's `FileHelpers` class demonstrates a several checks for buffered <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> and streamed file uploads. For processing <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> buffered file uploads in the sample app, see the `ProcessFormFile` method in the `Utilities/FileHelpers.cs` file. For processing streamed files, see the `ProcessStreamedFile` method in the same file.

> [!WARNING]
> The validation processing methods demonstrated in the sample app don't scan the content of uploaded files. In most production scenarios, a virus/malware scanner API is used on the file before making the file available to users or other systems.
>
> Although the topic sample provides a working example of validation techniques, don't implement the `FileHelpers` class in a production app unless you:
>
> * Fully understand the implementation.
> * Modify the implementation as appropriate for the app's environment and specifications.
>
> **Never indiscriminately implement security code in an app without addressing these requirements.**

### Content validation

**Use a third party virus/malware scanning API on uploaded content.**

Scanning files is demanding on server resources in high volume scenarios. If request processing performance is diminished due to file scanning, consider offloading the scanning work to a [background service](xref:fundamentals/host/hosted-services), possibly a service running on a server different from the app's server. Typically, uploaded files are held in a quarantined area until the background virus scanner checks them. When a file passes, the file is moved to the normal file storage location. These steps are usually performed in conjunction with a database record that indicates the scanning status of a file. By using such an approach, the app and app server remain focused on responding to requests.

### File extension validation

The uploaded file's extension should be checked against a list of permitted extensions. For example:

```csharp
private string[] permittedExtensions = { ".txt", ".pdf" };

var ext = Path.GetExtension(uploadedFileName).ToLowerInvariant();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(ext) || !permittedExtensions.Contains(ext))
{
    // The extension is invalid ... discontinue processing the file
}
```

### File signature validation

A file's signature is determined by the first few bytes at the start of a file. These bytes can be used to indicate if the extension matches the content of the file. The sample app checks file signatures for a few common file types. In the following example, the file signature for a JPEG image is checked against the file:

```csharp
private static readonly Dictionary<string, List<byte[]>> _fileSignature = 
    new Dictionary<string, List<byte[]>>
{
    { ".jpeg", new List<byte[]>
        {
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0 },
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE2 },
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE3 },
        }
    },
};

using (var reader = new BinaryReader(uploadedFileData))
{
    var signatures = _fileSignature[ext];
    var headerBytes = reader.ReadBytes(signatures.Max(m => m.Length));
    
    return signatures.Any(signature => 
        headerBytes.Take(signature.Length).SequenceEqual(signature));
}
```

To obtain additional file signatures, see the [File Signatures Database](https://www.filesignatures.net/) and official file specifications.

### File name security

Never use a client-supplied file name for saving a file to physical storage. Create a safe file name for the file using [Path.GetRandomFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetRandomFileName*) or [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) to create a full path (including the file name) for temporary storage.

Razor automatically HTML encodes property values for display. The following code is safe to use:

```cshtml
@foreach (var file in Model.DatabaseFiles) {
    <tr>
        <td>
            @file.UntrustedName
        </td>
    </tr>
}
```

Outside of Razor, always <xref:System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode*> file name content from a user's request.

Many implementations must include a check that the file exists; otherwise, the file is overwritten by a file of the same name. Supply additional logic to meet your app's specifications.

### Size validation

Limit the size of uploaded files.

In the sample app, the size of the file is limited to 2 MB (indicated in bytes). The limit is supplied via [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) from the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "FileSizeLimit": 2097152
}
```

The `FileSizeLimit` is injected into `PageModel` classes:

```csharp
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly long _fileSizeLimit;

    public BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel(IConfiguration config)
    {
        _fileSizeLimit = config.GetValue<long>("FileSizeLimit");
    }

    ...
}
```

When a file size exceeds the limit, the file is rejected:

```csharp
if (formFile.Length > _fileSizeLimit)
{
    // The file is too large ... discontinue processing the file
}
```

### Match name attribute value to parameter name of POST method

In non-Razor forms that POST form data or use JavaScript's `FormData` directly, the name specified in the form's element or `FormData` must match the name of the parameter in the controller's action.

In the following example:

* When using an `<input>` element, the `name` attribute is set to the value `battlePlans`:

  ```html
  <input type="file" name="battlePlans" multiple>
  ```

* When using `FormData` in JavaScript, the name is set to the value `battlePlans`:

  ```javascript
  var formData = new FormData();

  for (var file in files) {
    formData.append("battlePlans", file, file.name);
  }
  ```

Use a matching name for the parameter of the C# method (`battlePlans`):

* For a Razor Pages page handler method named `Upload`:

  ```csharp
  public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync(List<IFormFile> battlePlans)
  ```

* For an MVC POST controller action method:

  ```csharp
  public async Task<IActionResult> Post(List<IFormFile> battlePlans)
  ```

## Server and app configuration

### Multipart body length limit

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> sets the limit for the length of each multipart body. Form sections that exceed this limit throw an <xref:System.IO.InvalidDataException> when parsed. The default is 134,217,728 (128 MB). Customize the limit using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> setting in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.Configure<FormOptions>(options =>
    {
        // Set the limit to 256 MB
        options.MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456;
    });
}
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequestFormLimitsAttribute> is used to set the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> for a single page or action.

In a Razor Pages app, apply the filter with a [convention](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions) in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddRazorPages(options =>
{
    options.Conventions
        .AddPageApplicationModelConvention("/FileUploadPage",
            model.Filters.Add(
                new RequestFormLimitsAttribute()
                {
                    // Set the limit to 256 MB
                    MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456
                });
});
```

In a Razor Pages app or an MVC app, apply the filter to the page model or action method:

```csharp
// Set the limit to 256 MB
[RequestFormLimits(MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456)]
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    ...
}
```

### Kestrel maximum request body size

For apps hosted by Kestrel, the default maximum request body size is 30,000,000 bytes, which is approximately 28.6 MB. Customize the limit using the [MaxRequestBodySize](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#maximum-request-body-size) Kestrel server option:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.ConfigureKestrel((context, options) =>
            {
                // Handle requests up to 50 MB
                options.Limits.MaxRequestBodySize = 52428800;
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequestSizeLimitAttribute> is used to set the [MaxRequestBodySize](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#maximum-request-body-size) for a single page or action.

In a Razor Pages app, apply the filter with a [convention](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions) in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddRazorPages(options =>
{
    options.Conventions
        .AddPageApplicationModelConvention("/FileUploadPage",
            model =>
            {
                // Handle requests up to 50 MB
                model.Filters.Add(
                    new RequestSizeLimitAttribute(52428800));
            });
});
```

In a Razor pages app or an MVC app, apply the filter to the page handler class or action method:

```csharp
// Handle requests up to 50 MB
[RequestSizeLimit(52428800)]
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    ...
}
```

The `RequestSizeLimitAttribute` can also be applied using the [`@attribute`](xref:mvc/views/razor#attribute) Razor directive:

```cshtml
@attribute [RequestSizeLimitAttribute(52428800)]
```

### Other Kestrel limits

Other Kestrel limits may apply for apps hosted by Kestrel:

* [Maximum client connections](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#maximum-client-connections)
* [Request and response data rates](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#minimum-request-body-data-rate)

### IIS

The default request limit (`maxAllowedContentLength`) is 30,000,000 bytes, which is approximately 28.6 MB. Customize the limit in the `web.config` file. In the following example, the limit is set to 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes):

```xml
<system.webServer>
  <security>
    <requestFiltering>
      <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="52428800" />
    </requestFiltering>
  </security>
</system.webServer>
```

The `maxAllowedContentLength` setting only applies to IIS. For more information, see [Request Limits `<requestLimits>`](/iis/configuration/system.webServer/security/requestFiltering/requestLimits/).

Increase the maximum request body size for the HTTP request by setting <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IISServerOptions.MaxRequestBodySize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> in `Startup.ConfigureServices`. In the following example, the limit is set to 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes):

```csharp
services.Configure<IISServerOptions>(options =>
{
    options.MaxRequestBodySize = 52428800;
});
```

For more information, see <xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index#iis-options>.

## Troubleshoot

Below are some common problems encountered when working with uploading files and their possible solutions.

### Not Found error when deployed to an IIS server

The following error indicates that the uploaded file exceeds the server's configured content length:

```
HTTP 404.13 - Not Found
The request filtering module is configured to deny a request that exceeds the request content length.
```

For more information, see the [IIS](#iis) section.

### Connection failure

A connection error and a reset server connection probably indicates that the uploaded file exceeds Kestrel's maximum request body size. For more information, see the [Kestrel maximum request body size](#kestrel-maximum-request-body-size) section. Kestrel client connection limits may also require adjustment.

### Null Reference Exception with IFormFile

If the controller is accepting uploaded files using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> but the value is `null`, confirm that the HTML form is specifying an `enctype` value of `multipart/form-data`. If this attribute isn't set on the `<form>` element, the file upload doesn't occur and any bound <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> arguments are `null`. Also confirm that the [upload naming in form data matches the app's naming](#match-name-attribute-value-to-parameter-name-of-post-method).

### Stream was too long

The examples in this topic rely upon <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> to hold the uploaded file's content. The size limit of a `MemoryStream` is `int.MaxValue`. If the app's file upload scenario requires holding file content larger than 50 MB, use an alternative approach that doesn't rely upon a single `MemoryStream` for holding an uploaded file's content.

ASP.NET Core supports uploading one or more files using buffered model binding for smaller files and unbuffered streaming for larger files.

## Security considerations

Use caution when providing users with the ability to upload files to a server. Attackers may attempt to:

* Execute [denial of service](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/denial-of-service) attacks.
* Upload viruses or malware.
* Compromise networks and servers in other ways.

Security steps that reduce the likelihood of a successful attack are:

* Upload files to a dedicated file upload area, preferably to a non-system drive. A dedicated location makes it easier to impose security restrictions on uploaded files. Disable execute permissions on the file upload location.&dagger;
* Do **not** persist uploaded files in the same directory tree as the app.&dagger;
* Use a safe file name determined by the app. Don't use a file name provided by the user or the untrusted file name of the uploaded file.&dagger; HTML encode the untrusted file name when displaying it. For example, logging the file name or displaying in UI (Razor automatically HTML encodes output).
* Allow only approved file extensions for the app's design specification.&dagger; <!-- * Check the file format signature to prevent a user from uploading a masqueraded file.&dagger; For example, don't permit a user to upload an *.exe* file with a *.txt* extension. Add this back when we get instructions how to do this.  -->
* Verify that client-side checks are performed on the server.&dagger; Client-side checks are easy to circumvent.
* Check the size of an uploaded file. Set a maximum size limit to prevent large uploads.&dagger;
* When files shouldn't be overwritten by an uploaded file with the same name, check the file name against the database or physical storage before uploading the file.
* **Run a virus/malware scanner on uploaded content before the file is stored.**

&dagger;The sample app demonstrates an approach that meets the criteria.

> [!WARNING]
> Uploading malicious code to a system is frequently the first step to executing code that can:
>
> * Completely gain control of a system.
> * Overload a system with the result that the system crashes.
> * Compromise user or system data.
> * Apply graffiti to a public UI.
>
> For information on reducing the attack surface area when accepting files from users, see the following resources:
>
> * [Unrestricted File Upload](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)
> * [Azure Security: Ensure appropriate controls are in place when accepting files from users](/azure/security/azure-security-threat-modeling-tool-input-validation#controls-users)

For more information on implementing security measures, including examples from the sample app, see the [Validation](#validation) section.

## Storage scenarios

Common storage options for files include:

* Database

  * For small file uploads, a database is often faster than physical storage (file system or network share) options.
  * A database is often more convenient than physical storage options because retrieval of a database record for user data can concurrently supply the file content (for example, an avatar image).
  * A database is potentially less expensive than using a data storage service.

* Physical storage (file system or network share)

  * For large file uploads:
    * Database limits may restrict the size of the upload.
    * Physical storage is often less economical than storage in a database.
  * Physical storage is potentially less expensive than using a data storage service.
  * The app's process must have read and write permissions to the storage location. **Never grant execute permission.**

* Data storage service (for example, [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/))

  * Services usually offer improved scalability and resiliency over on-premises solutions that are usually subject to single points of failure.
  * Services are potentially lower cost in large storage infrastructure scenarios.

  For more information, see [Quickstart: Use .NET to create a blob in object storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet). The topic demonstrates <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Storage.File.CloudFile.UploadFromFileAsync*>, but <xref:Microsoft.Azure.Storage.File.CloudFile.UploadFromStreamAsync*> can be used to save a <xref:System.IO.FileStream> to blob storage when working with a <xref:System.IO.Stream>.

## File upload scenarios

Two general approaches for uploading files are buffering and streaming.

**Buffering**

The entire file is read into an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>, which is a C# representation of the file used to process or save the file.

The resources (disk, memory) used by file uploads depend on the number and size of concurrent file uploads. If an app attempts to buffer too many uploads, the site crashes when it runs out of memory or disk space. If the size or frequency of file uploads is exhausting app resources, use streaming.

> [!NOTE]
> Any single buffered file exceeding 64 KB is moved from memory to a temp file on disk.

Buffering small files is covered in the following sections of this topic:

* [Physical storage](#upload-small-files-with-buffered-model-binding-to-physical-storage)
* [Database](#upload-small-files-with-buffered-model-binding-to-a-database)

**Streaming**

The file is received from a multipart request and directly processed or saved by the app. Streaming doesn't improve performance significantly. Streaming reduces the demands for memory or disk space when uploading files.

Streaming large files is covered in the [Upload large files with streaming](#upload-large-files-with-streaming) section.

### Upload small files with buffered model binding to physical storage

To upload small files, use a multipart form or construct a POST request using JavaScript.

The following example demonstrates the use of a Razor Pages form to upload a single file (`Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysical.cshtml` in the sample app):

```cshtml
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile" type="file">
            <span asp-validation-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></span>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <input asp-page-handler="Upload" class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>
```

The following example is analogous to the prior example except that:

* JavaScript's ([Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)) is used to submit the form's data.
* There's no validation.

```cshtml
<form action="BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysical/?handler=Upload" 
      enctype="multipart/form-data" onsubmit="AJAXSubmit(this);return false;" 
      method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label for="FileUpload_FormFile">File</label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input id="FileUpload_FormFile" type="file" 
                name="FileUpload.FormFile" />
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload" />

    <div style="margin-top:15px">
        <output name="result"></output>
    </div>
</form>

<script>
  async function AJAXSubmit (oFormElement) {
    var resultElement = oFormElement.elements.namedItem("result");
    const formData = new FormData(oFormElement);

    try {
    const response = await fetch(oFormElement.action, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      window.location.href = '/';
    }

    resultElement.value = 'Result: ' + response.status + ' ' + 
      response.statusText;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  }
</script>
```

To perform the form POST in JavaScript for clients that [don't support the Fetch API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch), use one of the following approaches:

* Use a Fetch Polyfill (for example, [window.fetch polyfill (github/fetch)](https://github.com/github/fetch)).
* Use `XMLHttpRequest`. For example:

  ```javascript
  <script>
    "use strict";

    function AJAXSubmit (oFormElement) {
      var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
      oReq.onload = function(e) { 
      oFormElement.elements.namedItem("result").value = 
        'Result: ' + this.status + ' ' + this.statusText;
      };
      oReq.open("post", oFormElement.action);
      oReq.send(new FormData(oFormElement));
    }
  </script>
  ```

In order to support file uploads, HTML forms must specify an encoding type (`enctype`) of `multipart/form-data`.

For a `files` input element to support uploading multiple files provide the `multiple` attribute on the `<input>` element:

```cshtml
<input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFiles" type="file" multiple>
```

The individual files uploaded to the server can be accessed through [Model Binding](xref:mvc/models/model-binding) using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>. The sample app demonstrates multiple buffered file uploads for database and physical storage scenarios.

<a name="filename2"></a>

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** use the `FileName` property of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> other than for display and logging. When displaying or logging, HTML encode the file name. An attacker can provide a malicious filename, including full paths or relative paths. Applications should:
>
> * Remove the path from the user-supplied filename.
> * Save the HTML-encoded, path-removed filename for UI or logging.
> * Generate a new random filename for storage.
>
> The following code removes the path from the file name:
>
> ```csharp
> string untrustedFileName = Path.GetFileName(pathName);
> ```
>
> The examples provided thus far don't take into account security considerations. Additional information is provided by the following sections and the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/):
>
> * [Security considerations](#security-considerations)
> * [Validation](#validation)

When uploading files using model binding and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>, the action method can accept:

* A single <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>.
* Any of the following collections that represent several files:
  * <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFileCollection>
  * <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>\<<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>>
  * [List](xref:System.Collections.Generic.List`1)\<<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>>

> [!NOTE]
> Binding matches form files by name. For example, the HTML `name` value in `<input type="file" name="formFile">` must match the C# parameter/property bound (`FormFile`). For more information, see the [Match name attribute value to parameter name of POST method](#match-name-attribute-value-to-parameter-name-of-post-method) section.

The following example:

* Loops through one or more uploaded files.
* Uses [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) to return a full path for a file, including the file name. 
* Saves the files to the local file system using a file name generated by the app.
* Returns the total number and size of files uploaded.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync(List<IFormFile> files)
{
    long size = files.Sum(f => f.Length);

    foreach (var formFile in files)
    {
        if (formFile.Length > 0)
        {
            var filePath = Path.GetTempFileName();

            using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
            {
                await formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
            }
        }
    }

    // Process uploaded files
    // Don't rely on or trust the FileName property without validation.

    return Ok(new { count = files.Count, size });
}
```

Use `Path.GetRandomFileName` to generate a file name without a path. In the following example, the path is obtained from configuration:

```csharp
foreach (var formFile in files)
{
    if (formFile.Length > 0)
    {
        var filePath = Path.Combine(_config["StoredFilesPath"], 
            Path.GetRandomFileName());

        using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
        {
            await formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
        }
    }
}
```

The path passed to the <xref:System.IO.FileStream> *must* include the file name. If the file name isn't provided, an <xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException> is thrown at runtime.

Files uploaded using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> technique are buffered in memory or on disk on the server before processing. Inside the action method, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> contents are accessible as a <xref:System.IO.Stream>. In addition to the local file system, files can be saved to a network share or to a file storage service, such as [Azure Blob storage](/azure/visual-studio/vs-storage-aspnet5-getting-started-blobs).

For another example that loops over multiple files for upload and uses safe file names, see `Pages/BufferedMultipleFileUploadPhysical.cshtml.cs` in the sample app.

> [!WARNING]
> [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) throws an <xref:System.IO.IOException> if more than 65,535 files are created without deleting previous temporary files. The limit of 65,535 files is a per-server limit. For more information on this limit on Windows OS, see the remarks in the following topics:
>
> * [GetTempFileNameA function](/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettempfilenamea#remarks)
> * <xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*>

### Upload small files with buffered model binding to a database

To store binary file data in a database using [Entity Framework](/ef/core/index), define a <xref:System.Byte> array property on the entity:

```csharp
public class AppFile
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public byte[] Content { get; set; }
}
```

Specify a page model property for the class that includes an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile>:

```csharp
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadDbModel : PageModel
{
    ...

    [BindProperty]
    public BufferedSingleFileUploadDb FileUpload { get; set; }

    ...
}

public class BufferedSingleFileUploadDb
{
    [Required]
    [Display(Name="File")]
    public IFormFile FormFile { get; set; }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> can be used directly as an action method parameter or as a bound model property. The prior example uses a bound model property.

The `FileUpload` is used in the Razor Pages form:

```cshtml
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <label asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile"></label>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <input asp-for="FileUpload.FormFile" type="file">
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <input asp-page-handler="Upload" class="btn" type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
```

When the form is POSTed to the server, copy the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> to a stream and save it as a byte array in the database. In the following example, `_dbContext` stores the app's database context:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync()
{
    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        await FileUpload.FormFile.CopyToAsync(memoryStream);

        // Upload the file if less than 2 MB
        if (memoryStream.Length < 2097152)
        {
            var file = new AppFile()
            {
                Content = memoryStream.ToArray()
            };

            _dbContext.File.Add(file);

            await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        }
        else
        {
            ModelState.AddModelError("File", "The file is too large.");
        }
    }

    return Page();
}
```

The preceding example is similar to a scenario demonstrated in the sample app:

* `Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadDb.cshtml`
* `Pages/BufferedSingleFileUploadDb.cshtml.cs`

> [!WARNING]
> Use caution when storing binary data in relational databases, as it can adversely impact performance.
>
> Don't rely on or trust the `FileName` property of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> without validation. The `FileName` property should only be used for display purposes and only after HTML encoding.
>
> The examples provided don't take into account security considerations. Additional information is provided by the following sections and the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/mvc/models/file-uploads/samples/):

### Upload large files with streaming

The following example demonstrates how to use JavaScript to stream a file to a controller action. The file's antiforgery token is generated using a custom filter attribute and passed to the client HTTP headers instead of in the request body. Because the action method processes the uploaded data directly, form model binding is disabled by another custom filter. Within the action, the form's contents are read using a `MultipartReader`, which reads each individual `MultipartSection`, processing the file or storing the contents as appropriate. After the multipart sections are read, the action performs its own model binding.

The initial page response loads the form and saves an antiforgery token in a cookie (via the `GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute` attribute). The attribute uses ASP.NET Core's built-in [antiforgery support](xref:security/anti-request-forgery) to set a cookie with a request token:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Filters/Antiforgery.cs?name=snippet_GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute)]

The `DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute` is used to disable model binding:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Filters/ModelBinding.cs?name=snippet_DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute)]

In the sample app, `GenerateAntiforgeryTokenCookieAttribute` and `DisableFormValueModelBindingAttribute` are applied as filters to the page application models of `/StreamedSingleFileUploadDb` and `/StreamedSingleFileUploadPhysical` in `Startup.ConfigureServices` using [Razor Pages conventions](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions):

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddMvc&highlight=8-11,17-20)]

Since model binding doesn't read the form, parameters that are bound from the form don't bind (query, route, and header continue to work). The action method works directly with the `Request` property. A `MultipartReader` is used to read each section. Key/value data is stored in a `KeyValueAccumulator`. After the multipart sections are read, the contents of the `KeyValueAccumulator` are used to bind the form data to a model type.

The complete `StreamingController.UploadDatabase` method for streaming to a database with EF Core:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Controllers/StreamingController.cs?name=snippet_UploadDatabase)]

`MultipartRequestHelper` (`Utilities/MultipartRequestHelper.cs`):

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Utilities/MultipartRequestHelper.cs)]

The complete `StreamingController.UploadPhysical` method for streaming to a physical location:

[!code-csharp[](file-uploads/samples/2.x/SampleApp/Controllers/StreamingController.cs?name=snippet_UploadPhysical)]

In the sample app, validation checks are handled by `FileHelpers.ProcessStreamedFile`.

## Validation

The sample app's `FileHelpers` class demonstrates a several checks for buffered <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> and streamed file uploads. For processing <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> buffered file uploads in the sample app, see the `ProcessFormFile` method in the `Utilities/FileHelpers.cs` file. For processing streamed files, see the `ProcessStreamedFile` method in the same file.

> [!WARNING]
> The validation processing methods demonstrated in the sample app don't scan the content of uploaded files. In most production scenarios, a virus/malware scanner API is used on the file before making the file available to users or other systems.
>
> Although the topic sample provides a working example of validation techniques, don't implement the `FileHelpers` class in a production app unless you:
>
> * Fully understand the implementation.
> * Modify the implementation as appropriate for the app's environment and specifications.
>
> **Never indiscriminately implement security code in an app without addressing these requirements.**

### Content validation

**Use a third party virus/malware scanning API on uploaded content.**

Scanning files is demanding on server resources in high volume scenarios. If request processing performance is diminished due to file scanning, consider offloading the scanning work to a [background service](xref:fundamentals/host/hosted-services), possibly a service running on a server different from the app's server. Typically, uploaded files are held in a quarantined area until the background virus scanner checks them. When a file passes, the file is moved to the normal file storage location. These steps are usually performed in conjunction with a database record that indicates the scanning status of a file. By using such an approach, the app and app server remain focused on responding to requests.

### File extension validation

The uploaded file's extension should be checked against a list of permitted extensions. For example:

```csharp
private string[] permittedExtensions = { ".txt", ".pdf" };

var ext = Path.GetExtension(uploadedFileName).ToLowerInvariant();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(ext) || !permittedExtensions.Contains(ext))
{
    // The extension is invalid ... discontinue processing the file
}
```

### File signature validation

A file's signature is determined by the first few bytes at the start of a file. These bytes can be used to indicate if the extension matches the content of the file. The sample app checks file signatures for a few common file types. In the following example, the file signature for a JPEG image is checked against the file:

```csharp
private static readonly Dictionary<string, List<byte[]>> _fileSignature = 
    new Dictionary<string, List<byte[]>>
{
    { ".jpeg", new List<byte[]>
        {
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0 },
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE2 },
            new byte[] { 0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE3 },
        }
    },
};

using (var reader = new BinaryReader(uploadedFileData))
{
    var signatures = _fileSignature[ext];
    var headerBytes = reader.ReadBytes(signatures.Max(m => m.Length));
    
    return signatures.Any(signature => 
        headerBytes.Take(signature.Length).SequenceEqual(signature));
}
```

To obtain additional file signatures, see the [File Signatures Database](https://www.filesignatures.net/) and official file specifications.

### File name security

Never use a client-supplied file name for saving a file to physical storage. Create a safe file name for the file using [Path.GetRandomFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetRandomFileName*) or [Path.GetTempFileName](xref:System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName*) to create a full path (including the file name) for temporary storage.

Razor automatically HTML encodes property values for display. The following code is safe to use:

```cshtml
@foreach (var file in Model.DatabaseFiles) {
    <tr>
        <td>
            @file.UntrustedName
        </td>
    </tr>
}
```

Outside of Razor, always <xref:System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode*> file name content from a user's request.

Many implementations must include a check that the file exists; otherwise, the file is overwritten by a file of the same name. Supply additional logic to meet your app's specifications.

### Size validation

Limit the size of uploaded files.

In the sample app, the size of the file is limited to 2 MB (indicated in bytes). The limit is supplied via [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) from the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "FileSizeLimit": 2097152
}
```

The `FileSizeLimit` is injected into `PageModel` classes:

```csharp
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly long _fileSizeLimit;

    public BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel(IConfiguration config)
    {
        _fileSizeLimit = config.GetValue<long>("FileSizeLimit");
    }

    ...
}
```

When a file size exceeds the limit, the file is rejected:

```csharp
if (formFile.Length > _fileSizeLimit)
{
    // The file is too large ... discontinue processing the file
}
```

### Match name attribute value to parameter name of POST method

In non-Razor forms that POST form data or use JavaScript's `FormData` directly, the name specified in the form's element or `FormData` must match the name of the parameter in the controller's action.

In the following example:

* When using an `<input>` element, the `name` attribute is set to the value `battlePlans`:

  ```html
  <input type="file" name="battlePlans" multiple>
  ```

* When using `FormData` in JavaScript, the name is set to the value `battlePlans`:

  ```javascript
  var formData = new FormData();

  for (var file in files) {
    formData.append("battlePlans", file, file.name);
  }
  ```

Use a matching name for the parameter of the C# method (`battlePlans`):

* For a Razor Pages page handler method named `Upload`:

  ```csharp
  public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostUploadAsync(List<IFormFile> battlePlans)
  ```

* For an MVC POST controller action method:

  ```csharp
  public async Task<IActionResult> Post(List<IFormFile> battlePlans)
  ```

## Server and app configuration

### Multipart body length limit

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> sets the limit for the length of each multipart body. Form sections that exceed this limit throw an <xref:System.IO.InvalidDataException> when parsed. The default is 134,217,728 (128 MB). Customize the limit using the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> setting in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.Configure<FormOptions>(options =>
    {
        // Set the limit to 256 MB
        options.MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456;
    });
}
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequestFormLimitsAttribute> is used to set the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.FormOptions.MultipartBodyLengthLimit> for a single page or action.

In a Razor Pages app, apply the filter with a [convention](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions) in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddMvc()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions
            .AddPageApplicationModelConvention("/FileUploadPage",
                model.Filters.Add(
                    new RequestFormLimitsAttribute()
                    {
                        // Set the limit to 256 MB
                        MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456
                    });
    })
    .SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
```

In a Razor Pages app or an MVC app, apply the filter to the page model or action method:

```csharp
// Set the limit to 256 MB
[RequestFormLimits(MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 268435456)]
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    ...
}
```

### Kestrel maximum request body size

For apps hosted by Kestrel, the default maximum request body size is 30,000,000 bytes, which is approximately 28.6 MB. Customize the limit using the [MaxRequestBodySize](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#maximum-request-body-size) Kestrel server option:

```csharp
public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .ConfigureKestrel((context, options) =>
        {
            // Handle requests up to 50 MB
            options.Limits.MaxRequestBodySize = 52428800;
        });
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequestSizeLimitAttribute> is used to set the [MaxRequestBodySize](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#maximum-request-body-size) for a single page or action.

In a Razor Pages app, apply the filter with a [convention](xref:razor-pages/razor-pages-conventions) in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddMvc()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions
            .AddPageApplicationModelConvention("/FileUploadPage",
                model =>
                {
                    // Handle requests up to 50 MB
                    model.Filters.Add(
                        new RequestSizeLimitAttribute(52428800));
                });
    })
    .SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
```

In a Razor pages app or an MVC app, apply the filter to the page handler class or action method:

```csharp
// Handle requests up to 50 MB
[RequestSizeLimit(52428800)]
public class BufferedSingleFileUploadPhysicalModel : PageModel
{
    ...
}
```

### Other Kestrel limits

Other Kestrel limits may apply for apps hosted by Kestrel:

* [Maximum client connections](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#maximum-client-connections)
* [Request and response data rates](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#minimum-request-body-data-rate)

### IIS

The default request limit (`maxAllowedContentLength`) is 30,000,000 bytes, which is approximately 28.6 MB. Customize the limit in the `web.config` file. In the following example, the limit is set to 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes):

```xml
<system.webServer>
  <security>
    <requestFiltering>
      <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="52428800" />
    </requestFiltering>
  </security>
</system.webServer>
```

The `maxAllowedContentLength` setting only applies to IIS. For more information, see [Request Limits `<requestLimits>`](/iis/configuration/system.webServer/security/requestFiltering/requestLimits/).

Increase the maximum request body size for the HTTP request by setting <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IISServerOptions.MaxRequestBodySize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> in `Startup.ConfigureServices`. In the following example, the limit is set to 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes):

```csharp
services.Configure<IISServerOptions>(options =>
{
    options.MaxRequestBodySize = 52428800;
});
```

For more information, see <xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index#iis-options>.

## Troubleshoot

Below are some common problems encountered when working with uploading files and their possible solutions.

### Not Found error when deployed to an IIS server

The following error indicates that the uploaded file exceeds the server's configured content length:

```
HTTP 404.13 - Not Found
The request filtering module is configured to deny a request that exceeds the request content length.
```

For more information, see the [IIS](#iis) section.

### Connection failure

A connection error and a reset server connection probably indicates that the uploaded file exceeds Kestrel's maximum request body size. For more information, see the [Kestrel maximum request body size](#kestrel-maximum-request-body-size) section. Kestrel client connection limits may also require adjustment.

### Null Reference Exception with IFormFile

If the controller is accepting uploaded files using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> but the value is `null`, confirm that the HTML form is specifying an `enctype` value of `multipart/form-data`. If this attribute isn't set on the `<form>` element, the file upload doesn't occur and any bound <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IFormFile> arguments are `null`. Also confirm that the [upload naming in form data matches the app's naming](#match-name-attribute-value-to-parameter-name-of-post-method).

### Stream was too long

The examples in this topic rely upon <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> to hold the uploaded file's content. The size limit of a `MemoryStream` is `int.MaxValue`. If the app's file upload scenario requires holding file content larger than 50 MB, use an alternative approach that doesn't rely upon a single `MemoryStream` for holding an uploaded file's content.
