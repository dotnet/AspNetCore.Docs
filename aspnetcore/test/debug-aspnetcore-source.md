# Debug .NET and ASP.NET Core source code with Visual Studio

To debug .NET and ASP.NET Core source code in Visual Studio:

* In **Tools -> Options -> Debugging -> General**, un-check  **Enable Just My Code**.

  ![Enable Just My Code](~/test/debug-aspnetcore-source/image/justMyCode.png)

* Verify **Enable Source Link support**  is checked.

* In **Tool -> Options -> Debugging -> Symbols**, enable **Microsoft Symbol Servers**.

When you step into any .NET or ASP.NET Core code, Visual Studio displays the source code.  For example:

* Set a break point in `OnGet` in `Pages/Privacy.cshtml.cs` and select the **Privacy** link.
* Select one of the **Download Source and Continue Debugging** options.

The preceding instructions work for basic stepping into functions, but the optimized .NET code often removes local variables and functions. To disable optimizations and allow better source debugging:

* In **Tools -> Options -> Debugging -> General**, enable **Suppress JIT optimization on module load (Managed only)**:
  ![Suppress JIT optimization on module load ](~/test/debug-aspnetcore-source/image/supressJIT.png)
* Add the environment variable and value `COMPlus_ReadyToRun=0` to the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file:
  [!code-json[](~/test/debug-aspnetcore-source/code/launchSettings.json?highlight=18,26)]

If you have debugged an app before with the previous version of .NET, delete the `%TEMP%/SymbolCache` directory as it can have old PDBs that are out of date.
