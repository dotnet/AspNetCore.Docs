# Globalization and localization in ASP.NET Core

:::moniker range="> aspnetcore-5.0"

A multilingual website allows a website to reach a wider audience. ASP.NET Core provides services and middleware for localizing into different languages and cultures.

## Terms

* Globalization (G11N): The process of making an app support different languages and regions. The abbreviation comes from the first and last letters and the number of letters between them.
* Localization (L10N): The process of customizing a globalized app for specific languages and regions.
* Internationalization (I18N): Both globalization and localization.
* Culture: A language and, optionally, a region.
* Neutral culture: A culture that has a specified language, but not a region (for example "en", "es").
* Specific culture: A culture that has a specified language and region (for example, "en-US", "en-GB", "es-CL").
* Parent culture: The neutral culture that contains a specific culture (for example, "en" is the parent culture of "en-US" and "en-GB").
* Locale: A locale is the same as a culture.

## Language and country/region codes

The [RFC 4646](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4646.txt) format for the culture name is `<language code>-<country/region code>`, where `<language code>` identifies the language and `<country/region code>` identifies the subculture. For example, `es-CL` for Spanish (Chile), `en-US` for English (United States), and `en-AU` for English (Australia). [RFC 4646](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4646.txt) is a combination of an ISO 639 two-letter lowercase culture code associated with a language and an ISO 3166 two-letter uppercase subculture code associated with a country or region. For more information, see <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo?displayProperty=fullName>.

## Tasks to localize an app

Globalizing and localizing an app involves the following tasks:

* [Make an ASP.NET Core app's content localizable](xref:fundamentals/localization/make-content-localizable).
* [Provide localized resources for the cultures the app supports](xref:fundamentals/localization/provide-resources)
* [Implement a strategy to select the culture for each request](xref:fundamentals/localization/select-language-culture)
