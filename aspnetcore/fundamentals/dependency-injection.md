## Overview of dependency injection

A *dependency* is an object that another object depends on. Examine the following `MyDependency` class with a `WriteMessage` method that other classes depend on:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DIwebApp/MyDependency.cs?name=snippet)]

A class can create an instance of the `MyDependency` class to make use of its `WriteMessage` method. In the following example, the `MyDependency` class is a dependency of the `IndexModel` class:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DIwebApp/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

The class creates and directly depends on the `MyDependency` class. Code dependencies, such as in the previous example, are problematic and should be avoided for the following reasons:

* To replace `MyDependency` with a different implementation, the `IndexModel` class must be modified.
* If `MyDependency` has dependencies, they must also be configured by the `IndexModel` class. In a large project with multiple classes depending on `MyDependency`, the configuration code becomes scattered across the app.
* This implementation is difficult to unit test.

Dependency injection addresses these problems through:

* The use of an interface or base class to abstract the dependency implementation.
* Registration of the dependency in a service container. ASP.NET Core provides a built-in service container, <xref:System.IServiceProvider>. Services are typically registered in the app's `Program.cs` file.
* *Injection* of the service into the constructor of the class where it's used. The framework takes on the responsibility of creating an instance of the dependency and disposing of it when it's no longer needed.

In the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/fundamentals/dependency-injection/samples/6.x), the `IMyDependency` interface defines the `WriteMessage` method:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Interfaces/IMyDependency.cs?name=snippet1)]

This interface is implemented by a concrete type, `MyDependency`:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Services/MyDependency.cs?name=snippet1)]

The sample app registers the `IMyDependency` service with the concrete type `MyDependency`. The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollectionServiceExtensions.AddScoped%2A> method registers the service with a scoped lifetime, the lifetime of a single request. [Service lifetimes](#service-lifetimes) are described later in this topic.

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Program.cs?name=snippet1)]

In the sample app, the `IMyDependency` service is requested and used to call the `WriteMessage` method:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Pages/Index2.cshtml.cs?name=snippet1)]

By using the DI pattern, the controller or Razor Page:

* Doesn't use the concrete type `MyDependency`, only the `IMyDependency` interface it implements. That makes it easy to change the implementation without modifying the controller or Razor Page.
* Doesn't create an instance of `MyDependency`, it's created by the DI container.

The implementation of the `IMyDependency` interface can be improved by using the built-in logging API:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Services/MyDependency.cs?name=snippet2)]

The updated `Program.cs` registers the new `IMyDependency` implementation:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Program.cs?name=snippet2)]

`MyDependency2` depends on <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger%601>, which it requests in the constructor. `ILogger<TCategoryName>` is a [framework-provided service](#framework-provided-services).

It's not unusual to use dependency injection in a chained fashion. Each requested dependency in turn requests its own dependencies. The container resolves the dependencies in the graph and returns the fully resolved service. The collective set of dependencies that must be resolved is typically referred to as a *dependency tree*, *dependency graph*, or *object graph*.

The container resolves `ILogger<TCategoryName>` by taking advantage of [(generic) open types](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/types#open-and-closed-types), eliminating the need to register every [(generic) constructed type](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/types#constructed-types).

In dependency injection terminology, a service:

* Is typically an object that provides a service to other objects, such as the `IMyDependency` service.
* Is not related to a web service, although the service may use a web service.

The framework provides a robust [logging](xref:fundamentals/logging/index) system. The `IMyDependency` implementations shown in the preceding examples were written to demonstrate basic DI, not to implement logging. Most apps shouldn't need to write loggers. The following code demonstrates using the default logging, which doesn't require any services to be registered:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Pages/About.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

Using the preceding code, there is no need to update `Program.cs`, because [logging](xref:fundamentals/logging/index) is provided by the framework.

## Register groups of services with extension methods

The ASP.NET Core framework uses a convention for registering a group of related services. The convention is to use a single `Add{GROUP_NAME}` extension method to register all of the services required by a framework feature. For example, the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.AddControllers%2A> extension method registers the services required for MVC controllers.

The following code is generated by the Razor Pages template using individual user accounts and shows how to add additional services to the container using the extension methods <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDbContext%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServiceCollectionUIExtensions.AddDefaultIdentity%2A>:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/ProgramEF.cs?name=snippet)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/combine-di6.md)]

## Service lifetimes

See [Service lifetimes](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

To use scoped services in middleware, use one of the following approaches:

* Inject the service into the middleware's `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method. Using [constructor injection](xref:mvc/controllers/dependency-injection#constructor-injection) throws a runtime exception because it forces the scoped service to behave like a singleton. The sample in the [Lifetime and registration options](#lifetime-and-registration-options) section demonstrates the `InvokeAsync` approach.
* Use [Factory-based middleware](xref:fundamentals/middleware/extensibility). Middleware registered using this approach is activated per client request (connection), which allows scoped services to be injected into the middleware's constructor.

For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/middleware/write#per-request-middleware-dependencies>.

## Service registration methods

See [Service registration methods](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-registration-methods) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

 It's common to use multiple implementations when [mocking types for testing](xref:test/integration-tests#inject-mock-services).

Registering a service with only an implementation type is equivalent to registering that service with the same implementation and service type. This is why multiple implementations of a service cannot be registered using the methods that don't take an explicit service type. These methods can register multiple *instances* of a service, but they will all have the same *implementation* type.

Any of the above service registration methods can be used to register multiple service instances of the same service type. In the following example, `AddSingleton` is called twice with `IMyDependency` as the service type. The second call to `AddSingleton` overrides the previous one when resolved as `IMyDependency` and adds to the previous one when multiple services are resolved via `IEnumerable<IMyDependency>`. Services appear in the order they were registered when resolved via `IEnumerable<{SERVICE}>`.

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, DifferentDependency>();

public class MyService
{
    public MyService(IMyDependency myDependency, 
       IEnumerable<IMyDependency> myDependencies)
    {
        Trace.Assert(myDependency is DifferentDependency);

        var dependencyArray = myDependencies.ToArray();
        Trace.Assert(dependencyArray[0] is MyDependency);
        Trace.Assert(dependencyArray[1] is DifferentDependency);
    }
}
```

## Constructor injection behavior

See [Constructor injection behavior](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#constructor-injection-behavior) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

## Entity Framework contexts

By default, Entity Framework contexts are added to the service container using the [scoped lifetime](#service-lifetimes) because web app database operations are normally scoped to the client request. To use a different lifetime, specify the lifetime by using an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDbContext%2A> overload. Services of a given lifetime shouldn't use a database context with a lifetime that's shorter than the service's lifetime.

## Lifetime and registration options

To demonstrate the difference between service lifetimes and their registration options, consider the following interfaces that represent a task as an operation with an identifier, `OperationId`. Depending on how the lifetime of an operation's service is configured for the following interfaces, the container provides either the same or different instances of the service when requested by a class:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Interfaces/IOperation.cs?name=snippet1)]

The following `Operation` class implements all of the preceding interfaces. The `Operation` constructor generates a GUID and stores the last 4 characters in the `OperationId` property:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Models/Operation.cs?name=snippet1)]

The following code creates multiple registrations of the `Operation` class according to the named lifetimes:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Program.cs?name=snippet3&highlight=5-7,20)]

The sample app demonstrates object lifetimes both within and between requests. The `IndexModel` and the middleware request each kind of `IOperation` type and log the `OperationId` for each:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet1)]

Similar to the `IndexModel`, the middleware resolves the same services:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Middleware/MyMiddleware.cs?name=snippet)]

Scoped and transient services must be resolved in the `InvokeAsync` method:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Middleware/MyMiddleware.cs?name=snippet2&highlight=2)]

The logger output shows:

* *Transient* objects are always different. The transient `OperationId` value is different in the `IndexModel` and in the middleware.
* *Scoped* objects are the same for a given request but differ across each new request.
* *Singleton* objects are the same for every request.

To reduce the logging output, set "Logging:LogLevel:Microsoft:Error" in the `appsettings.Development.json` file:

[!code-json[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/appsettings.Development.json?highlight=7)]

## Resolve a service at app start up

The following code shows how to resolve a scoped service for a limited duration when the app starts:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/WebApp1/Program.cs?highlight=3,7-13)]

## Scope validation

See [Constructor injection behavior](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#constructor-injection-behavior) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

For more information, see [Scope validation](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#scope-validation).

## Request Services

Services and their dependencies within an ASP.NET Core request are exposed through <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext.RequestServices?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

The framework creates a scope per request, and `RequestServices` exposes the scoped service provider. All scoped services are valid for as long as the request is active.

> [!NOTE]
> Prefer requesting dependencies as constructor parameters over resolving services from `RequestServices`. Requesting dependencies as constructor parameters yields classes that are easier to test.

## Design services for dependency injection

When designing services for dependency injection:

* Avoid stateful, static classes and members. Avoid creating global state by designing apps to use singleton services instead.
* Avoid direct instantiation of dependent classes within services. Direct instantiation couples the code to a particular implementation.
* Make services small, well-factored, and easily tested.

If a class has a lot of injected dependencies, it might be a sign that the class has too many responsibilities and violates the [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](/dotnet/standard/modern-web-apps-azure-architecture/architectural-principles#single-responsibility). Attempt to refactor the class by moving some of its responsibilities into new classes. Keep in mind that Razor Pages page model classes and MVC controller classes should focus on UI concerns.

### Disposal of services

The container calls <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> for the <xref:System.IDisposable> types it creates. Services resolved from the container should never be disposed by the developer. If a type or factory is registered as a singleton, the container disposes the singleton automatically.

In the following example, the services are created by the service container and disposed automatically:
                dependency-injection\samples\6.x\DIsample2\Services\Service1.cs
[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Services/Service1.cs?name=snippet)]

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

The debug console shows the following output after each refresh of the Index page:

```console
Service1: IndexModel.OnGet
Service2: IndexModel.OnGet
Service3: IndexModel.OnGet
Service1.Dispose
```

### Services not created by the service container

Consider the following code:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Program.cs?name=snippet3)]

In the preceding code:

* The service instances aren't created by the service container.
* The framework doesn't dispose of the services automatically.
* The developer is responsible for disposing the services.

### IDisposable guidance for Transient and shared instances

See [IDisposable guidance for Transient and shared instance](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-guidelines#idisposable-guidance-for-transient-and-shared-instances) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

## Default service container replacement

See [Default service container replacement](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-guidelines#default-service-container-replacement) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

## Recommendations

See [Recommendations](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-guidelines#recommendations) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

* Avoid using the *service locator pattern*. For example, don't invoke <xref:System.IServiceProvider.GetService%2A> to obtain a service instance when you can use DI instead:

  **Incorrect:**

    ![Incorrect code](dependency-injection/_static/bad.png)

  **Correct**:

  ```csharp
  public class MyClass
  {
      private readonly IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> _optionsMonitor;

      public MyClass(IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> optionsMonitor)
      {
          _optionsMonitor = optionsMonitor;
      }

      public void MyMethod()
      {
          var option = _optionsMonitor.CurrentValue.Option;

          ...
      }
  }
  ```
* Another service locator variation to avoid is injecting a factory that resolves dependencies at runtime. Both of these practices mix [Inversion of Control](/dotnet/standard/modern-web-apps-azure-architecture/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion) strategies.
* Avoid static access to `HttpContext` (for example, [IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext)).

<!--
<a name="ASP0000"></a>
* Avoid calls to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions.BuildServiceProvider%2A> in `ConfigureServices`.  For example, consider the case where the `LoginPath` is loaded from configuration. Avoid the following approach:

  ![bad code calling BuildServiceProvider](~/fundamentals/dependency-injection/_static/badcodeX.png)

  In the preceding image, selecting the green wavy line under `services.BuildServiceProvider` shows the following ASP0000 warning:

  > ASP0000 Calling 'BuildServiceProvider' from application code results in an additional copy of singleton services being created. Consider alternatives such as dependency injecting services as parameters to 'Configure'.

  Calling `BuildServiceProvider` creates a second container, which can create torn singletons and cause references to object graphs across multiple containers.

  A correct way to get `LoginPath` is to use the options pattern's built-in support for DI:

  [!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/6.x/AntiPattern3/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

* Disposable transient services are captured by the container for disposal. This can turn into a memory leak if resolved from the top level container.
* Enable scope validation to make sure the app doesn't have singletons that capture scoped services. For more information, see [Scope validation](#scope-validation).

Like all sets of recommendations, you may encounter situations where ignoring a recommendation is required. Exceptions are rare, mostly special cases within the framework itself.
-->
DI is an *alternative* to static/global object access patterns. You may not be able to realize the benefits of DI if you mix it with static object access.

## Recommended patterns for multi-tenancy in DI

[Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore) is an application framework for building modular, multi-tenant applications on ASP.NET Core. For more information, see the [Orchard Core Documentation](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/).

See the [Orchard Core samples](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Samples) for examples of how to build modular and multi-tenant apps using just the Orchard Core Framework without any of its CMS-specific features.

## Framework-provided services

`Program.cs` registers services that the app uses, including platform features, such as Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core MVC. Initially, the `IServiceCollection` provided to `Program.cs` has services defined by the framework depending on [how the host was configured](xref:fundamentals/index#host). For apps based on the ASP.NET Core templates, the framework registers more than 250 services.

The following table lists a small sample of these framework-registered services:

| Service Type                                                                                    | Lifetime  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Builder.IApplicationBuilderFactory?displayProperty=fullName> | Transient |
| <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime>                                    | Singleton |

## Overview of dependency injection

A *dependency* is an object that another object depends on. Examine the following `MyDependency` class with a `WriteMessage` method that other classes depend on:

```csharp
public class MyDependency
{
    public void WriteMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"MyDependency.WriteMessage called. Message: {message}");
    }
}
```

A class can create an instance of the `MyDependency` class to make use of its `WriteMessage` method. In the following example, the `MyDependency` class is a dependency of the `IndexModel` class:

```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly MyDependency _dependency = new MyDependency();

    public void OnGet()
    {
        _dependency.WriteMessage("IndexModel.OnGet created this message.");
    }
}
```

The class creates and directly depends on the `MyDependency` class. Code dependencies, such as in the previous example, are problematic and should be avoided for the following reasons:

* To replace `MyDependency` with a different implementation, the `IndexModel` class must be modified.
* If `MyDependency` has dependencies, they must also be configured by the `IndexModel` class. In a large project with multiple classes depending on `MyDependency`, the configuration code becomes scattered across the app.
* This implementation is difficult to unit test. The app should use a mock or stub `MyDependency` class, which isn't possible with this approach.

Dependency injection addresses these problems through:

* The use of an interface or base class to abstract the dependency implementation.
* Registration of the dependency in a service container. ASP.NET Core provides a built-in service container, <xref:System.IServiceProvider>. Services are typically registered in the app's `Startup.ConfigureServices` method.
* *Injection* of the service into the constructor of the class where it's used. The framework takes on the responsibility of creating an instance of the dependency and disposing of it when it's no longer needed.

In the [sample app](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/fundamentals/dependency-injection/samples), the `IMyDependency` interface defines the `WriteMessage` method:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Interfaces/IMyDependency.cs?name=snippet1)]

This interface is implemented by a concrete type, `MyDependency`:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Services/MyDependency.cs?name=snippet1)]

The sample app registers the `IMyDependency` service with the concrete type `MyDependency`. The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollectionServiceExtensions.AddScoped%2A> method registers the service with a scoped lifetime, the lifetime of a single request. [Service lifetimes](#service-lifetimes) are described later in this topic.

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/StartupMyDependency.cs?name=snippet1)]

In the sample app, the `IMyDependency` service is requested and used to call the `WriteMessage` method:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Pages/Index2.cshtml.cs?name=snippet1)]

By using the DI pattern, the controller:

* Doesn't use the concrete type `MyDependency`, only the `IMyDependency` interface it implements. That makes it easy to change the implementation that the controller uses without modifying the controller.
* Doesn't create an instance of `MyDependency`, it's created by the DI container.

The implementation of the `IMyDependency` interface can be improved by using the built-in logging API:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Services/MyDependency.cs?name=snippet2)]

The updated `ConfigureServices` method registers the new `IMyDependency` implementation:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/StartupMyDependency2.cs?name=snippet1)]

`MyDependency2` depends on <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger%601>, which it requests in the constructor. `ILogger<TCategoryName>` is a [framework-provided service](#framework-provided-services).

It's not unusual to use dependency injection in a chained fashion. Each requested dependency in turn requests its own dependencies.

* Is typically an object that provides a service to other objects, such as the `IMyDependency` service.
* Is not related to a web service, although the service may use a web service.

The following code demonstrates using the default logging, which doesn't require any services to be registered in `ConfigureServices`:

Using the preceding code, there is no need to update `ConfigureServices`, because [logging](xref:fundamentals/logging/index) is provided by the framework.

## Services injected into Startup

Services can be injected into the `Startup` constructor and the `Startup.Configure` method.

Only the following services can be injected into the `Startup` constructor when using the Generic Host (<xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostBuilder>):

Any service registered with the DI container can be injected into the `Startup.Configure` method:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, ILogger<Startup> logger)
{
    ...
}
```

For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/startup> and [Access configuration in Startup](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index#access-configuration-in-startup).

## Register groups of services with extension methods

The ASP.NET Core framework uses a convention for registering a group of related services. The convention is to use a single `Add{GROUP_NAME}` extension method to register all of the services required by a framework feature. For example, the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.AddControllers%2A> extension method registers the services required for MVC controllers.

The following code is generated by the Razor Pages template using individual user accounts and shows how to add additional services to the container using the extension methods <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDbContext%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IdentityServiceCollectionUIExtensions.AddDefaultIdentity%2A>:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/StartupEF.cs?name=snippet)]

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/combine-di.md)]

## Service lifetimes

See [Service lifetimes](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

To use scoped services in middleware, use one of the following approaches:

* Inject the service into the middleware's `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method. Using [constructor injection](xref:mvc/controllers/dependency-injection#constructor-injection) throws a runtime exception because it forces the scoped service to behave like a singleton. The sample in the [Lifetime and registration options](#lifetime-and-registration-options) section demonstrates the `InvokeAsync` approach.
* Use [Factory-based middleware](xref:fundamentals/middleware/extensibility). Middleware registered using this approach is activated per client request (connection), which allows scoped services to be injected into the middleware's `InvokeAsync` method.

For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/middleware/write#per-request-middleware-dependencies>.

## Service registration methods

See [Service registration methods](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-registration-methods) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

 It's common to use multiple implementations when [mocking types for testing](xref:test/integration-tests#inject-mock-services).

Registering a service with only an implementation type is equivalent to registering that service with the same implementation and service type. This is why multiple implementations of a service cannot be registered using the methods that don't take an explicit service type. These methods can register multiple *instances* of a service, but they will all have the same *implementation* type.

Any of the above service registration methods can be used to register multiple service instances of the same service type. In the following example, `AddSingleton` is called twice with `IMyDependency` as the service type. The second call to `AddSingleton` overrides the previous one when resolved as `IMyDependency` and adds to the previous one when multiple services are resolved via `IEnumerable<IMyDependency>`. Services appear in the order they were registered when resolved via `IEnumerable<{SERVICE}>`.

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
services.AddSingleton<IMyDependency, DifferentDependency>();

public class MyService
{
    public MyService(IMyDependency myDependency, 
       IEnumerable<IMyDependency> myDependencies)
    {
        Trace.Assert(myDependency is DifferentDependency);

        var dependencyArray = myDependencies.ToArray();
        Trace.Assert(dependencyArray[0] is MyDependency);
        Trace.Assert(dependencyArray[1] is DifferentDependency);
    }
}
```

## Constructor injection behavior

See [Constructor injection behavior](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#constructor-injection-behavior) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

## Entity Framework contexts

By default, Entity Framework contexts are added to the service container using the [scoped lifetime](#service-lifetimes) because web app database operations are normally scoped to the client request. To use a different lifetime, specify the lifetime by using an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDbContext%2A> overload. Services of a given lifetime shouldn't use a database context with a lifetime that's shorter than the service's lifetime.

## Lifetime and registration options

To demonstrate the difference between service lifetimes and their registration options, consider the following interfaces that represent a task as an operation with an identifier, `OperationId`. Depending on how the lifetime of an operation's service is configured for the following interfaces, the container provides either the same or different instances of the service when requested by a class:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Interfaces/IOperation.cs?name=snippet1)]

The following `Operation` class implements all of the preceding interfaces. The `Operation` constructor generates a GUID and stores the last 4 characters in the `OperationId` property:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Models/Operation.cs?name=snippet1)]

The `Startup.ConfigureServices` method creates multiple registrations of the `Operation` class according to the named lifetimes:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Startup2.cs?name=snippet1)]

The sample app demonstrates object lifetimes both within and between requests. The `IndexModel` and the middleware request each kind of `IOperation` type and log the `OperationId` for each:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet1)]

Similar to the `IndexModel`, the middleware resolves the same services:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Middleware/MyMiddleware.cs?name=snippet)]

Scoped services must be resolved in the `InvokeAsync` method:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Middleware/MyMiddleware.cs?name=snippet2&highlight=2)]

The logger output shows:

* *Transient* objects are always different. The transient `OperationId` value is different in the `IndexModel` and in the middleware.
* *Scoped* objects are the same for a given request but differ across each new request.
* *Singleton* objects are the same for every request.

To reduce the logging output, set "Logging:LogLevel:Microsoft:Error" in the `appsettings.Development.json` file:

[!code-json[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/appsettings.Development.json?highlight=7)]

## Call services from main

Create an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceScope> with [IServiceScopeFactory.CreateScope](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceScopeFactory.CreateScope%2A) to resolve a scoped service within the app's scope. This approach is useful to access a scoped service at startup to run initialization tasks.

The following example shows how to access the scoped `IMyDependency` service and call its `WriteMessage` method in `Program.Main`:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DependencyInjectionSample/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

<a name="sv"></a>

## Scope validation

See [Constructor injection behavior](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#constructor-injection-behavior) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

For more information, see [Scope validation](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#scope-validation).

## Request Services

Services and their dependencies within an ASP.NET Core request are exposed through <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext.RequestServices?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

The framework creates a scope per request, and `RequestServices` exposes the scoped service provider. All scoped services are valid for as long as the request is active.

> [!NOTE]
> Prefer requesting dependencies as constructor parameters over resolving services from `RequestServices`. Requesting dependencies as constructor parameters yields classes that are easier to test.

## Design services for dependency injection

When designing services for dependency injection:

* Avoid stateful, static classes and members. Avoid creating global state by designing apps to use singleton services instead.
* Avoid direct instantiation of dependent classes within services. Direct instantiation couples the code to a particular implementation.
* Make services small, well-factored, and easily tested.

If a class has a lot of injected dependencies, it might be a sign that the class has too many responsibilities and violates the [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](/dotnet/standard/modern-web-apps-azure-architecture/architectural-principles#single-responsibility). Attempt to refactor the class by moving some of its responsibilities into new classes. Keep in mind that Razor Pages page model classes and MVC controller classes should focus on UI concerns.

### Disposal of services

The container calls <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> for the <xref:System.IDisposable> types it creates. Services resolved from the container should never be disposed by the developer. If a type or factory is registered as a singleton, the container disposes the singleton automatically.

In the following example, the services are created by the service container and disposed automatically:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Services/Service1.cs?name=snippet)]

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Startup.cs?name=snippet)]

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

The debug console shows the following output after each refresh of the Index page:

```console
Service1: IndexModel.OnGet
Service2: IndexModel.OnGet
Service3: IndexModel.OnGet
Service1.Dispose
```

### Services not created by the service container

Consider the following code:

[!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/DIsample2/DIsample2/Startup2.cs?name=snippet)]

In the preceding code:

* The service instances aren't created by the service container.
* The framework doesn't dispose of the services automatically.
* The developer is responsible for disposing the services.

### IDisposable guidance for Transient and shared instances

See [IDisposable guidance for Transient and shared instance](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-guidelines#idisposable-guidance-for-transient-and-shared-instances) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

## Default service container replacement

See [Default service container replacement](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-guidelines#default-service-container-replacement) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

## Recommendations

See [Recommendations](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-guidelines#recommendations) in [Dependency injection in .NET](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

* Avoid using the *service locator pattern*. For example, don't invoke <xref:System.IServiceProvider.GetService%2A> to obtain a service instance when you can use DI instead:

  **Incorrect:**

    ![Incorrect code](dependency-injection/_static/bad.png)

  **Correct**:

  ```csharp
  public class MyClass
  {
      private readonly IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> _optionsMonitor;

      public MyClass(IOptionsMonitor<MyOptions> optionsMonitor)
      {
          _optionsMonitor = optionsMonitor;
      }

      public void MyMethod()
      {
          var option = _optionsMonitor.CurrentValue.Option;

          ...
      }
  }
  ```
* Another service locator variation to avoid is injecting a factory that resolves dependencies at runtime. Both of these practices mix [Inversion of Control](/dotnet/standard/modern-web-apps-azure-architecture/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion) strategies.
* Avoid static access to `HttpContext` (for example, [IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext)).

<a name="ASP0000"></a>
* Avoid calls to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions.BuildServiceProvider%2A> in `ConfigureServices`. Calling `BuildServiceProvider` typically happens when the developer wants to resolve a service in `ConfigureServices`. For example, consider the case where the `LoginPath` is loaded from configuration. Avoid the following approach:

  ![bad code calling BuildServiceProvider](~/fundamentals/dependency-injection/_static/badcodeX.png)

  In the preceding image, selecting the green wavy line under `services.BuildServiceProvider` shows the following ASP0000 warning:

  > ASP0000 Calling 'BuildServiceProvider' from application code results in an additional copy of singleton services being created. Consider alternatives such as dependency injecting services as parameters to 'Configure'.

  Calling `BuildServiceProvider` creates a second container, which can create torn singletons and cause references to object graphs across multiple containers.

  A correct way to get `LoginPath` is to use the options pattern's built-in support for DI:

  [!code-csharp[](dependency-injection/samples/3.x/AntiPattern3/Startup.cs?name=snippet)]

* Disposable transient services are captured by the container for disposal. This can turn into a memory leak if resolved from the top level container.
* Enable scope validation to make sure the app doesn't have singletons that capture scoped services. For more information, see [Scope validation](#scope-validation).

Like all sets of recommendations, you may encounter situations where ignoring a recommendation is required. Exceptions are rare, mostly special cases within the framework itself.

DI is an *alternative* to static/global object access patterns. You may not be able to realize the benefits of DI if you mix it with static object access.

## Recommended patterns for multi-tenancy in DI

[Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore) is an application framework for building modular, multi-tenant applications on ASP.NET Core. For more information, see the [Orchard Core Documentation](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/).

See the [Orchard Core samples](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Samples) for examples of how to build modular and multi-tenant apps using just the Orchard Core Framework without any of its CMS-specific features.

## Framework-provided services

The `Startup.ConfigureServices` method registers services that the app uses, including platform features, such as Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core MVC. Initially, the `IServiceCollection` provided to `ConfigureServices` has services defined by the framework depending on [how the host was configured](xref:fundamentals/index#host). For apps based on the ASP.NET Core templates, the framework registers more than 250 services. 

The following table lists a small sample of these framework-registered services:

| Service Type                                                                                    | Lifetime  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Builder.IApplicationBuilderFactory?displayProperty=fullName> | Transient |
| <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime>                                    | Singleton |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment>                                         | Singleton |

| <xref:System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticListener?displayProperty=fullName>                           | Singleton |
