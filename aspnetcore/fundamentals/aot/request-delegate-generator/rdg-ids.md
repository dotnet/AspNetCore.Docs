# ASP.NET Core Request Delegate Generator (RDG) diagnostics

The ASP.NET Core Request Delegate Generator (RDG) is a tool that generates request delegates for ASP.NET Core apps. The RDG is used by the native ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler to generate request delegates for the app's `Map` methods.

The following list contains the [RDG diagnostics](https://source.dot.net/#Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.RequestDelegateGenerator/DiagnosticDescriptors.cs,44128aef6daa9b5e) for ASP.NET Core:
