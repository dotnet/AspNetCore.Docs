# RDG002: Unable to resolve endpoint handler

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG002|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the Request Delegate Generator when an endpoint contains a route handler that cannot be statically analyzed.

### Rule description

The Request Delegate Generator runs at compile-time and needs to be able to statically analyze route handlers in an application. The implementation currently only supports route handlers that are provided as lambda expression, method group references, or references to read-only fields or variables.

```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

var del = Wrapper.GetTodos;
app.MapGet("/v1/todos", del);

app.Run();

record Todo(int Id, string Task);

class Wrapper
{
    public static Func<IResult> GetTodos = ()
    	=> Results.Ok((List<Todo>)[new Todo(1, "Write tests"), new Todo(2, "Fix tests")]);
}
```

## How to fix violations

Declare the route handler using supported syntax, such as an inline lambda.
```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

app.MapGet("/v1/todos", ()
	=> Results.Ok((List<Todo>)[new Todo(1, "Write tests"), new Todo(2, "Fix tests")]));

app.Run();

record Todo(int Id, string Task);
```

## When to suppress warnings

This warning can be safely suppressed. When suppressed, the framework will fallback to generating the request delegate at runtime.
