# RDG004: Unable to resolve anonymous type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG004|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the [Request Delegate Generator](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/aot/request-delegate-generator/rdg) when an endpoint contains a route handler with an anonymous return type.

### Rule description

The Request Delegate Generator runs at compile-time and needs to be able to statically analyze route handlers in an app. [Anonymous types](/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/anonymous-types) are generated with a type name only known to the complier and aren't statically analyzable. The following endpoint produces the diagnostic.

## How to fix violations

Declare the route handler with a concrete type as the return type.

## When to suppress warnings

This warning can be safely suppressed. When suppressed, the framework falls back to generating the request delegate at runtime.
