# RDG004: Unable to resolve anonymous type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG004|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the Request Delegate Generator when an endpoint contains a route handler with an anonymous return type.

### Rule description

The Request Delegate Generator runs at compile-time and needs to be able to statically analyze route handlers in an application. Anonymous types are generated with an unspeakable type name and are not statically analyzable. The following endpoint will produce the diagnostic.

```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

app.MapGet("/v1/todos", () => new { Id = 1, Task = "Write tests" });

app.Run();
```

## How to fix violations

Declare the route handler with a concrete type as the return type.
```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

app.MapGet("/v1/todos", () => new Todo(1, "Write tests");

app.Run();

record Todo(int Id, string Task);
```

## When to suppress warnings

This warning can be safely suppressed. When suppressed, the framework will fallback to generating the request delegate at runtime.
