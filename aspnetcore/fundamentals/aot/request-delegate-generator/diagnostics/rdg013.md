# RDG013: Invalid source attributes

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG013|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the Request Delegate Generator when an endpoint contains a route handler with a parameter that contains an invalid combination of serivce source attributes.

### Rule description

ASP.NET Core supports resolving keyed and non-keyed services via dependency injection. It is not feasible to resolve a service as both keyed and non-keyed. The following code sample will produce the diagnostic.

```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

app.MapGet("/vl/todos", ([FromKeyedService("primary")] [FromService] ITodoService todoService) 
	=> Results.Ok(todoService.GetTodos()));

app.Run();

record Todo(int Id, string Task);
interface ITodoService
{
	Todo[] GetTodos();
}
```

## How to fix violations

Resolve the target parameter as either a keyed or non-keyed service.
```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

app.MapGet("/vl/todos", ([FromKeyedService("primary")] ITodoService todoService) 
	=> Results.Ok(todoService.GetTodos()));
// OR
app.MapGet("/vl/todos", ([FromService] ITodoService todoService) 
	=> Results.Ok(todoService.GetTodos()));

app.Run();

record Todo(int Id, string Task);
interface ITodoService
{
	Todo[] GetTodos();
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

This warning should not be suppressed. Suppressing the warning will lead to a runtime exception assocaited with the same warning.
