# RDG001: Unable to resolve route pattern

[!INCLUDE[](~/aspnetcore/fundamentals/aot/includes/aot_preview.md)]

| Diagnostic| Value |
|-|-|
| **Diagnostic ID** |RDG001|
| **Diagnostic Severity** |<xref:Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.DiagnosticSeverity.Warning>|
| **isEnabledByDefault** |`true`|

## Cause

The Request Delegate Generator (RDG) is unable to resolve the route pattern for the `Map` method.

## Solution

The RDG is unable to resolve the route pattern for the `Map` method. The route pattern must be a constant string or a constant string concatenated with a constant expression. The route pattern can't be a variable or a non-constant expression.
