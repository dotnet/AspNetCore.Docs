# RDG012: Unable to resolve inaccessible type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG012|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the Request Delegate Generator when an endpoint contains a route handler with a parameter without the appropriate accessibility modifiers.

### Rule description

Endpoints that use an inaccessible type (`private` or `protected`) are not supported. 
The endpoints within `MapEndpoints` produce this diagnostic because of the `Todo` type has the `private` accessibility modifiers.

## How to fix violations

When applicable, set the target parameter type with a friendly accessibility.

## When to suppress warnings

This warning can be safely suppressed. When suppressed, the framework will fallback to generating the request delegate at runtime.
