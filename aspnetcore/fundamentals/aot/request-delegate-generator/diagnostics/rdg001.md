# RDG001: Unable to resolve route pattern

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG001|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the Request Delegate Generator when an endpoint contains a route pattern that cannot be statically analyzed including route patterns that contain variable references.

### Rule description

The Request Delegate Generator runs at compile-time and needs to be able to statically analyze route handlers in an application. The implementation does not currently support flow analysis to understand references to route pattern store in variables. The endpoint defined in the following application will produce the RDG001 diagnostic.

```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

var version = "v1";
var route = $"/{version}/todos";

app.MapGet(route, () => Results.Ok([new Todo(1, "Write tests"), new Todo(2, "Fix tests")]));

app.Run();

record Todo(int Id, string Task);
```

## How to fix violations

Declare the route pattern as an inline string literal in the route handler.
```razor
var app = WebApplication.Create();

app.MapGet("/v1/todos", () => Results.Ok([new Todo(1, "Write tests"), new Todo(2, "Fix tests")]));

app.Run();

record Todo(int Id, string Task);
```

## When to suppress warnings

This warning can be safely suppressed. When suppressed, the framework will fallback to generating the request delegate at runtime.
