# RDG010: Unexpected nullable type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG010|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the Request Delegate Generator when an endpoint contains a route handler with an anonymous return type

### Rule description

The Request Delegate Generator runs at compile-time and needs to be able to statically analyze route handlers in an application. The implementation currently only supports route handlers that are provided as lambda expression, method group references, or references to read-only fields or variables.

```

## How to fix violations

Declare the route pattern as an inline string literal in the route handler.

## When to suppress warnings

This warning can be safely suppressed. When suppressed, the framework will fallback to generating the request delegate at runtime.
