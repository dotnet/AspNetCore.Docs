# RDG010: InvalidAsParameters Nullable

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG010|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the [Request Delegate Generator](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/aot/request-delegate-generator/rdg) when an endpoint contains a route handler with a parameter annotated with the [`[AsParameters]`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.AsParametersAttribute) attribute that is marked as nullable.


### Rule description

The implementation of surrogate binding via the [`[AsParameters]`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.AsParametersAttribute) attribute in minimal APIs only supports types that are not nullable.
