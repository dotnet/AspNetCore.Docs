# RDG007: No valid constructor found

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |RDG007|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This diagnostic is emitted by the [Request Delegate Generator](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/aot/request-delegate-generator/rdg) when an endpoint contains a route handler with a parameter annotated with the [`[AsParameters]`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.AsParametersAttribute) attribute with no valid constructor.

### Rule description

Types that are used for surrogate binding via the `AsParameters` attribute must contain a public constructor. The `TodoRequest` type produces this diagnostic because there is no public constructor.

## How to fix violations

Remove the non-public constructor, or add a new public constructor.
