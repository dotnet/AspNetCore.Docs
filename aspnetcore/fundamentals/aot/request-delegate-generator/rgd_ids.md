# ASP.NET Core Request Delegate Generator (RDG) diagnostics

The ASP.NET Core Request Delegate Generator (RDG) is a tool that generates request delegates for ASP.NET Core apps. The RDG is used by the native ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler to generate request delegates for the app's `Map` methods.

[!INCLUDE[](~/aspnetcore/fundamentals/aot/includes/aot_preview.md)]


The following list contains the RDG diagnostics for ASP.NET Core:
