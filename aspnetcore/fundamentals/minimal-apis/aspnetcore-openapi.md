# Get started with Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi

The Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi package provides built-in support for OpenAPI document generation in ASP.NET Core. The package is:

* Compatible with native AoT
* Takes advantage of JSON schema support provided by System.Text.Json
* Provides a transformers API for modifying generated documents
* Supports managing multiple OpenAPI documents within a single application

## Package installation

`Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` can be added with the following approaches:

### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* From the **Package Manager Console** window:
  * Go to **View** > **Other Windows** > **Package Manager Console**
  * Navigate to the directory in which the `.csproj` file exists
  * Execute the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi -Version 9.0.0
    ```

* From the **Manage NuGet Packages** dialog:
  * Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** > **Manage NuGet Packages**
  * Set the **Package source** to "nuget.org"
  * Ensure the "Include prerelease" option is enabled
  * Enter "Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi" in the search box
  * Select the latest "Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi" package from the **Browse** tab and click **Install**

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

Run the following command from the **Integrated Terminal**:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi -v 9.0.0
```

### [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

Run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi -v 9.0.0
```

## Add and configure OpenAPI document generation

To get started generating OpenAPI documents for ASP.NET Core applications, add the OpenAPI-related services to `Program.cs`.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApi();
```

Then, enable the endpoint for viewing the OpenAPI document in JSON format.

```csharp
app.MapOpenApi();
```

Launch the app and navigate to `https://localhost:<port>/openapi/v1.json` to view the generated OpenAPI document.

## Options for customizing OpenAPI document generation

### The importance of document names

Each OpenAPI document in an application has a unique name. The default document name that is registered is `v1`.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApi(); // Document name is v1
```

The document name can be modified by passing the name as a parameter to the `AddOpenApi` call.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApi("internal"); // Document name is internal
```

The document name surfaces in several places in the OpenAPI implementation.

When fetching the generated OpenAPI document, the document name is provided as the `documentName` parameter argument in the request. The requests below will resolve the `v1` and `internal` documents respectively.

```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/openapi/v1.json
GET http://localhost:5000/openapi/internal.json
```

### Customizing the OpenAPI version of a generated document

By default, OpenAPI document generation will generate a document that is compliant with v3.0 of the OpenAPI spec. To modify this version, customize the options that are provided to the document generation services.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApi(options =>
{
    options.OpenApiVersion = OpenApiSpecVersion.OpenApi2_0;
});
```

### Customizing the OpenAPI endpoint route

By default, the OpenAPI endpoint registered via a call to `MapOpenApi` will expose the document at the `/openapi/{documentName}.json` endpoint. To customize the route the OpenAPI document is registered at, pass the route template as a parameter to the `MapOpenApi` call.

```csharp
app.MapOpenApi("/openapi/{documentName}/openapi.json");
```

> Note: It's possible, but not recommended, to remove the `documentName` route parameter from the endpoint route. In this case, the framework will attempt to resolve the document name from the query parameter. Not providing the `documentName` in either the route or query can result in unexpected behavior. 

## Customizing OpenAPI documents with transformers

Transformers provide an API for modifying the OpenAPI document that is generated by the framework with user-defined customizations. Transformers are useful for scenarios like adding parameters to all operations in a document, modifying descriptions for parameters or operations, and adding top-level information to the OpenAPI document.

Transformers fall into two categories:

* Document transformers have access to the entire OpenAPI document and can be used to make global modifications to the document.
* Operation transformers apply to each individual operation (combination of path + HTTP method) and can be used to modify parameters or responses on endpoints.

Transformers can be registered onto the document via the `UseTransformers` call on the `OpenApiOptions` object.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApi(options =>
{
    options.UseTransformer((document, context, cancellationToken) => {});
    options.UseTransformer(new MyDocumentTransformer());
    options.UseTransformer<MyDocumentTransformer>();
    options.UseOperationTransformer((operation, context, cancellationToken) => {});
})
```

The snippet below shows the three strategies for registering transformers onto the document:

* Registering a document transformer using a delegate
* Registering a document transformer using an instance of `IOpenApiDocumentTransformer`
* Registering a document transformer using a DI-activated `IOpenApiDocumentTransformer`
* Register an operation transformer using a delegate

### Execution order for transformers

Transformers execute in first-in first-out order based on registration. In the snippet below, the document transformer will have access to the modifications made by the operation transformer. 

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApi(options =>
{
    options.UseOperationTransformer((operation, context, cancellationToken) => {});
    options.UseTransformer((document, context, cancellationToken) => {});
});
```


### Using document transformers

Document transformers have access to a context object that includes:

* The name of the document being modified
* The list of ApiDescriptionGroups associated with that document
* The IServiceProvider used in document generation

Document transformers also have mutate access to the OpenAPI document that has been generated. The following example demonstrates a document transformer that adds some information about the API author to the OpenAPI document.

[!code-csharp[](~/fundamentals/minimal-apis/9.0-samples/WebMinOpenApi/Program.cs?name=snippet_documenttransformer1)]

Service-activated document transformers can also be used to implement transformers that rely on instances from DI to modify the application. The sample below demonstrates a document transformer that uses the `IAuthenticationSchemeProvider` service from the authentication layer to check if any JWT bearer-related schemes are registered in the application and add them to the OpenAPI document's top-level. 

[!code-csharp[](~/fundamentals/minimal-apis/9.0-samples/WebMinOpenApi/Program.cs?name=snippet_documenttransformer2)]

Document transformers are unique to the document instance they are associated with. In the example below, a transformer registers authentication-related requirements to the `internal` document but leaves the `public` document unmodified.

### Using operation transformers

Operations are unique combinations of HTTP paths and methods in an OpenAPI document. Operation transformers are helpful when a modification should be made to each endpoint in an application or conditionally applied to certain routes.

Operation transformers have access to a context object which contains:

* The name of the document the operation belongs to
* The ApiDescription associated with the operation
* The IServiceProvider used in document generation

For example, this operation transformer adds 500 as a response status code supported by all operations in the document.

[!code-csharp[](~/fundamentals/minimal-apis/9.0-samples/WebMinOpenApi/Program.cs?name=snippet_operationtransformer1)]

## Using the generated OpenAPI document

OpenAPI documents can plug into a wide ecosystem of existing tools for testing, documentation, and local development.

### Using Swagger UI for local ad-hoc testing

By default, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` package does not ship with built-in support for visualizing or interacting with the OpenAPI document. Popular tools for achieving this kind of thing include Swagger UI and ReDoc and can be integrated in your application in a variety of ways. Editors like Visual Studio and VS Code offer extensions and built-in experiences for testing against an OpenAPI document.

The `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUi` package provides a bundle of Swagger UI's web assets for use in applications. This package can be used to render a UI for the generated document. To configure this, install the `Swashbuckle.ASpNetCore.SwaggerUi` package.

### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* From the **Package Manager Console** window:
  * Go to **View** > **Other Windows** > **Package Manager Console**
  * Navigate to the directory in which the `.csproj` file exists
  * Execute the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUi -v 6.5.0
    ```

* From the **Manage NuGet Packages** dialog:
  * Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** > **Manage NuGet Packages**
  * Set the **Package source** to "nuget.org"
  * Ensure the "Include prerelease" option is enabled
  * Enter "Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUi" in the search box
  * Select the latest "Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUi" package from the **Browse** tab and click **Install**

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

Run the following command from the **Integrated Terminal**:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUi -v 6.5.0
```

### [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

Run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUi -v 6.5.0
```

---

Then, enable the swagger-ui middleware with a reference to the OpenAPI route registered earlier. To limit information disclosure and security vulnerability concerns, it's recommended to only enable Swagger UI in development environments.

### Linting generated OpenAPI documents with Spectral

Spectral is an open-source OpenAPI document linter. Spectral can be incorporated into your application build to verify the quality of generated OpenAPI documents. Install Spectral according to the [package installation directions]https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral#-installation).

To take advantage of Spectral, you must enable build-time OpenAPI document generation. To do so, install the `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` package to enable build-time OpenAPI document generation.

### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* From the **Package Manager Console** window:
  * Go to **View** > **Other Windows** > **Package Manager Console**
  * Navigate to the directory in which the `.csproj` file exists
  * Execute the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server -v 9.0.0
    ```

* From the **Manage NuGet Packages** dialog:
  * Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** > **Manage NuGet Packages**
  * Set the **Package source** to "nuget.org"
  * Ensure the "Include prerelease" option is enabled
  * Enter "Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server" in the search box
  * Select the latest "Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server" package from the **Browse** tab and click **Install**

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

Run the following command from the **Integrated Terminal**:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server -v 9.0.0
```

### [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

Run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server -v 9.0.0
```

---

Then, enable document generation at build-time by setting the following properties in your application's `.csproj` file.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <OpenApiDocumentsDirectory>$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)</OpenApiDocumentsDirectory>
    <OpenApiGenerateDocuments>true</OpenApiGenerateDocuments>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Run `dotnet build` to generate the document.

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
```

Create a `.spectral.yml` file with the following contents.

```text
extends: ["spectral:oas"]
```


Then, run `spectral lint` on the generated file.

```dotnetcli
spectral lint WebMinOpenApi.json
...
