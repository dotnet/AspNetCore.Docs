# Host filtering with ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server

While Kestrel supports configuration based on prefixes such as `http://example.com:5000`, Kestrel largely ignores the host name. Host `localhost` is a special case used for binding to loopback addresses. Any host other than an explicit IP address binds to all public IP addresses. `Host` headers aren't validated.

As a workaround, use Host Filtering Middleware. The middleware is added by <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder%2A>, which calls <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HostFilteringServicesExtensions.AddHostFiltering%2A>:

[!code-csharp[](samples-snapshot/2.x/KestrelSample/Program.cs?name=snippet_Program&highlight=9)]

Host Filtering Middleware is disabled by default. To enable the middleware, define an `AllowedHosts` key in `appsettings.json`/`appsettings.{Environment}.json`. The value is a semicolon-delimited list of host names without port numbers:

`appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "AllowedHosts": "example.com;localhost"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> [Forwarded Headers Middleware](xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer) also has an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ForwardedHeadersOptions.AllowedHosts> option. Forwarded Headers Middleware and Host Filtering Middleware have similar functionality for different scenarios. Setting `AllowedHosts` with Forwarded Headers Middleware is appropriate when the `Host` header isn't preserved while forwarding requests with a reverse proxy server or load balancer. Setting `AllowedHosts` with Host Filtering Middleware is appropriate when Kestrel is used as a public-facing edge server or when the `Host` header is directly forwarded.
