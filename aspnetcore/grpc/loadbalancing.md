# gRPC client-side load balancing

By [James Newton-King](https://twitter.com/jamesnk)

Client-side load balancing is a feature that allows gRPC clients to distribute load optimally across available servers. This article discusses how to configure client-side load balancing to create scalable, high-performance gRPC apps in .NET.

Client-side load balancing requires:

* .NET 5 or later.
* [`Grpc.Net.Client`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Net.Client) version 2.45.0 or later.

## Configure gRPC client-side load balancing

Client-side load balancing is configured when a channel is created. The two components to consider when using load balancing:

* The resolver, which resolves the addresses for the channel. Resolvers support getting addresses from an external source. This is also known as service discovery.
* The load balancer, which creates connections and picks the address that a gRPC call will use.

Built-in implementations of resolvers and load balancers are included in [`Grpc.Net.Client`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Net.Client). Load balancing can also be extended by [writing custom resolvers and load balancers](#write-custom-resolvers-and-load-balancers).

Addresses, connections and other load balancing state is stored in a `GrpcChannel` instance. A channel must be reused when making gRPC calls for load balancing to work correctly.

## Configure resolver

The resolver is configured using the address a channel is created with. The [URI scheme](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax) of the address specifies the resolver.

| Scheme   | Type                    | Description |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| `dns`    | `DnsResolverFactory`    | Resolves addresses by querying the hostname for [DNS address records](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#A). |
| `static` | `StaticResolverFactory` | Resolves addresses that the app has specified. Recommended if an app already knows the addresses it calls. |

A channel doesn't directly call a URI that matches a resolver. Instead, a matching resolver is created and used to resolve the addresses.

For example, using `GrpcChannel.ForAddress("dns:///my-example-host", new GrpcChannelOptions { Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure })`:

* The `dns` scheme maps to `DnsResolverFactory`. A new instance of a DNS resolver is created for the channel.
* The resolver makes a DNS query for `my-example-host` and gets two results: `localhost:80` and `localhost:81`.
* The load balancer uses `localhost:80` and `localhost:81` to create connections and make gRPC calls.

#### DnsResolverFactory

The `DnsResolverFactory` creates a resolver designed to get addresses from an external source. DNS resolution is commonly used to load balance over pod instances that have a [Kubernetes headless services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services).

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(
    "dns:///my-example-host",
    new GrpcChannelOptions { Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure });
var client = new Greet.GreeterClient(channel);

var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "world" });
```

The preceding code:

* Configures the created channel with the address `dns:///my-example-host`. The `dns` scheme maps to `DnsResolverFactory`.
* Doesn't specify a load balancer. The channel defaults to a pick first load balancer.
* Starts the gRPC call `SayHello`:
  * DNS resolver gets addresses for the hostname `my-example-host`.
  * Pick first load balancer attempts to connect to one of the resolved addresses.
  * The call is sent to the first address the channel successfully connects to.

##### DNS address caching

Performance is important when load balancing. The latency of resolving addresses is eliminated from gRPC calls by caching the addresses. A resolver will be invoked when making the first gRPC call, and subsequent calls use the cache.

Addresses are automatically refreshed if a connection is interrupted. Refreshing is important in scenarios where addresses change at runtime. For example, in Kubernetes a [restarted pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/) triggers the DNS resolver to refresh and get the pod's new address.

By default, a DNS resolver is refreshed if a connection is interrupted. The DNS resolver can also optionally refresh itself on a periodic interval. This can be useful for quickly detecting new pod instances. 

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ResolverFactory>(
    sp => new DnsResolverFactory(refreshInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)));
```

The preceding code creates a `DnsResolverFactory` with a refresh interval and registers it with dependency injection. For more information on using a custom-configured resolver, see [Configure custom resolvers and load balancers](#configure-custom-resolvers-and-load-balancers).

#### StaticResolverFactory

A static resolver is provided by `StaticResolverFactory`. This resolver:

* Doesn't call an external source. Instead, the client app configures the addresses.
* Is designed for situations where an app already knows the addresses it calls.

```csharp
var factory = new StaticResolverFactory(addr => new[]
{
    new BalancerAddress("localhost", 80),
    new BalancerAddress("localhost", 81)
});

var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.AddSingleton<ResolverFactory>(factory);

var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(
    "static:///my-example-host",
    new GrpcChannelOptions
    {
        Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure,
        ServiceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider()
    });
var client = new Greet.GreeterClient(channel);
```

The preceding code:

* Creates a `StaticResolverFactory`. This factory knows about two addresses: `localhost:80` and `localhost:81`.
* Registers the factory with dependency injection (DI).
* Configures the created channel with:
  * The address `static:///my-example-host`. The `static` scheme maps to a static resolver.
  * Sets `GrpcChannelOptions.ServiceProvider` with the DI service provider.

This example creates a new <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollection> for DI. Suppose an app already has DI setup, like an ASP.NET Core website. In that case, types should be registered with the existing DI instance. `GrpcChannelOptions.ServiceProvider` is configured by getting an <xref:System.IServiceProvider> from DI.

## Configure load balancer

A load balancer is specified in a [`service config`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/service_config.md) using the `ServiceConfig.LoadBalancingConfigs` collection. Two load balancers are built-in and map to load balancer config names:

| Name          | Type                            | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `pick_first`  | `PickFirstLoadBalancerFactory`  | Attempts to connect to addresses until a connection is successfully made. gRPC calls are all made to the first successful connection. |
| `round_robin` | `RoundRobinLoadBalancerFactory` | Attempts to connect to all addresses. gRPC calls are distributed across all successful connections using [round-robin](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/round-robin-load-balancing/) logic. |

`service config` is an abbreviation of service configuration and is represented by the `ServiceConfig` type. There are a couple of ways a channel can get a `service config` with a load balancer configured:

* An app can specify a `service config` when a channel is created using `GrpcChannelOptions.ServiceConfig`.
* Alternatively, a resolver can resolve a `service config` for a channel. This feature allows an external source to specify how its callers should perform load balancing. Whether a resolver supports resolving a `service config` is dependent on the resolver implementation. Disable this feature with `GrpcChannelOptions.DisableResolverServiceConfig`.
* If no `service config` is provided, or the `service config` doesn't have a load balancer configured, the channel defaults to `PickFirstLoadBalancerFactory`.

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(
    "dns:///my-example-host",
    new GrpcChannelOptions
    {
        Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure,
        ServiceConfig = new ServiceConfig { LoadBalancingConfigs = { new RoundRobinConfig() } }
    });
var client = new Greet.GreeterClient(channel);

var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "world" });
```

The preceding code:

* Specifies a `RoundRobinLoadBalancerFactory` in the `service config`.
* Starts the gRPC call `SayHello`:
  * `DnsResolverFactory` creates a resolver that gets addresses for the hostname `my-example-host`.
  * Round-robin load balancer attempts to connect to all resolved addresses.
  * gRPC calls are distributed evenly using round-robin logic.

## Configure channel credentials

A channel must know whether gRPC calls are sent using [transport security](xref:grpc/security#transport-security). `http` and `https` are no longer part of the address, the scheme now specifies a resolver, so `Credentials` must be configured on channel options when using load balancing.

* `ChannelCredentials.SecureSsl` - gRPC calls are secured with [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246). Equivalent to an `https` address.
* `ChannelCredentials.Insecure` - gRPC calls don't use transport security. Equivalent to an `http` address.

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(
    "dns:///my-example-host",
    new GrpcChannelOptions { Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure });
var client = new Greet.GreeterClient(channel);

var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = "world" });
```

## Write custom resolvers and load balancers

Client-side load balancing is extensible:

* Implement `Resolver` to create a custom resolver and resolve addresses from a new data source.
* Implement `LoadBalancer` to create a custom load balancer with new load balancing behavior.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The APIs used to extend client-side load balancing are experimental. They can change without notice.

### Create a custom resolver

A resolver:

* Implements `Resolver` and is created by a `ResolverFactory`. Create a custom resolver by implementing these types.
* Is responsible for resolving the addresses a load balancer uses.
* Can optionally provide a service configuration.

```csharp
public class FileResolver : PollingResolver
{
    private readonly Uri _address;
    private readonly int _port;

    public ExampleResolver(Uri address, int defaultPort, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        : base(loggerFactory)
    {
        _address = address;
        _port = defaultPort;
    }

    public override async Task ResolveAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Load JSON from a file on disk and deserialize into endpoints.
        var jsonString = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(_address.LocalPath);
        var results = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<string[]>(jsonString);
        var addresses = results.Select(r => new BalancerAddress(r, _port)).ToArray();

        // Pass the results back to the channel.
        Listener(ResolverResult.ForResult(addresses));
    }
}

public class FileResolverFactory : ResolverFactory
{
    // Create a FileResolver when the URI has a 'file' scheme.
    public override string Name => "file";

    public override Resolver Create(ResolverOptions options)
    {
        return new FileResolver(options.Address, options.DefaultPort, options.LoggerFactory);
    }
}
```

In the preceding code:

* `FileResolverFactory` implements `ResolverFactory`. It maps to the `file` scheme and creates `FileResolver` instances.
* `FileResolver` implements `PollingResolver`. `PollingResolver` is an abstract base type that makes it easy to implement a resolver with asynchronous logic by overriding `ResolveAsync`.
* In `ResolveAsync`:
  * The file URI is converted to a local path. For example, `file:///c:/addresses.json` becomes `c:\addresses.json`.
  * JSON is loaded from disk and converted into a collection of addresses.
  * Listener is called with results to let the channel know that addresses are available.

### Create a custom load balancer

A load balancer:

* Implements `LoadBalancer` and is created by a `LoadBalancerFactory`. Create a custom load balancer and factory by implementing these types.
* Is given addresses from a resolver and creates `Subchannel` instances.
* Tracks state about the connection and creates a `SubchannelPicker`. The channel internally uses the picker to pick addresses when making gRPC calls.

The `SubchannelsLoadBalancer` is:

* An abstract base class that implements `LoadBalancer`.
* Manages creating `Subchannel` instances from addresses.
* Makes it easy to implement a custom picking policy over a collection of subchannels.

```csharp
public class RandomBalancer : SubchannelsLoadBalancer
{
    public RandomBalancer(IChannelControlHelper controller, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        : base(controller, loggerFactory)
    {
    }

    protected override SubchannelPicker CreatePicker(List<Subchannel> readySubchannels)
    {
        return new RandomPicker(readySubchannels);
    }

    private class RandomPicker : SubchannelPicker
    {
        private readonly List<Subchannel> _subchannels;

        public RandomPicker(List<Subchannel> subchannels)
        {
            _subchannels = subchannels;
        }

        public override PickResult Pick(PickContext context)
        {
            // Pick a random subchannel.
            return PickResult.ForSubchannel(_subchannels[Random.Shared.Next(0, _subchannels.Count)]);
        }
    }
}

public class RandomBalancerFactory : LoadBalancerFactory
{
    // Create a RandomBalancer when the name is 'random'.
    public override string Name => "random";

    public override LoadBalancer Create(LoadBalancerOptions option)
    {
        return new RandomBalancer(options.Controller, options.LoggerFactory);
    }
}
```

In the preceding code:

* `RandomBalancerFactory` implements `LoadBalancerFactory`. It maps to the `random` policy name and creates `RandomBalancer` instances.
* `RandomBalancer` implements `SubchannelsLoadBalancer`. It creates a `RandomPicker` that randomly picks a subchannel.

## Configure custom resolvers and load balancers

Custom resolvers and load balancers need to be registered with dependency injection (DI) when they are used. There are a couple of options:

* If an app is already using DI, such as an ASP.NET Core web app, they can be registered with the existing DI configuration. An <xref:System.IServiceProvider> can be resolved from DI and passed to the channel using `GrpcChannelOptions.ServiceProvider`.
* If an app isn't using DI then create:
  * A <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollection> with types registered with it.
  * A service provider using <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions.BuildServiceProvider*>.

```csharp
var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.AddSingleton<ResolverFactory, FileResolverFactory>();
services.AddSingleton<LoadBalancerFactory, RandomLoadBalancerFactory>();

var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(
    "file:///c:/data/addresses.json",
    new GrpcChannelOptions
    {
        Credentials = ChannelCredentials.Insecure,
        ServiceConfig = new ServiceConfig { LoadBalancingConfigs = { new LoadBalancingConfig("random") } },
        ServiceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider()
    });
var client = new Greet.GreeterClient(channel);
```

The preceding code:

* Creates a `ServiceCollection` and registers new resolver and load balancer implementations.
* Creates a channel configured to use the new implementations:
  * `ServiceCollection` is built into an `IServiceProvider` and set to `GrpcChannelOptions.ServiceProvider`.
  * Channel address is `file:///c:/data/addresses.json`. The `file` scheme maps to `FileResolverFactory`.
  * `service config` load balancer name is `random`. Maps to `RandomLoadBalancerFactory`.

## Why load balancing is important

HTTP/2 multiplexes multiple calls on a single TCP connection. If gRPC and HTTP/2 are used with a network load balancer (NLB), the connection is forwarded to a server, and all gRPC calls are sent to that one server. The other server instances on the NLB are idle.

Network load balancers are a common solution for load balancing because they are fast and lightweight. For example, Kubernetes by default uses a network load balancer to balance connections between pod instances. However, network load balancers are not effective at distributing load when used with gRPC and HTTP/2.

### Proxy or client-side load balancing?

gRPC and HTTP/2 can be effectively load balanced using either an application load balancer proxy or client-side load balancing. Both of these options allow individual gRPC calls to be distributed across available servers. Deciding between proxy and client-side load balancing is an architectural choice. There are pros and cons for each.

* **Proxy**: gRPC calls are sent to the proxy, the proxy makes a load balancing decision, and the gRPC call is sent on to the final endpoint. The proxy is responsible for knowing about endpoints. Using a proxy adds:

  * An additional network hop to gRPC calls.
  * Latency and consumes additional resources.
  * Proxy server must be setup and configured correctly.

* **Client-side load balancing**: The gRPC client makes a load balancing decision when a gRPC call is started. The gRPC call is sent directly to the final endpoint. When using client-side load balancing:

  * The client is responsible for knowing about available endpoints and making load balancing decisions.
  * Additional client configuration is required.
  * High-performance, load balanced gRPC calls eliminate the need for a proxy.
