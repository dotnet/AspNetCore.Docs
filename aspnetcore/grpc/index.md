# Introduction to gRPC on .NET Core

By [John Luo](https://github.com/juntaoluo) and [James Newton-King](https://twitter.com/jamesnk)

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/) is a language agnostic, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

The main benefits of gRPC are:
* Modern, high-performance, lightweight RPC framework.
* Contract-first API development, using Protocol Buffers by default, allowing for language agnostic implementations.
* Tooling available for many languages to generate strongly-typed servers and clients.
* Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming calls.
* Reduced network usage with Protobuf binary serialization.

These benefits make gRPC ideal for:
* Lightweight microservices where efficiency is critical.
* Polyglot systems where multiple languages are required for development.
* Point-to-point real-time services that need to handle streaming requests or responses.

## C# Tooling support for .proto files

gRPC uses a contract-first approach to API development. Services and messages are defined in *\*.proto* files:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

.NET types for services, clients and messages are automatically generated by including *\*.proto* files in a project:

* Add a package reference to [Grpc.Tools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Tools/) package.
* Add *\*.proto* files to the `<Protobuf>` item group.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Protobuf Include="Protos\greet.proto" />
</ItemGroup>
```

For more information on gRPC tooling support, see <xref:grpc/basics>.

## gRPC services on ASP.NET Core

gRPC services can be hosted on ASP.NET Core. Services have full integration with popular ASP.NET Core features such as logging, dependency injection (DI), authentication and authorization.

The gRPC service project template provides a starter service:

```csharp
public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<GreeterService> _logger;

    public GreeterService(ILogger<GreeterService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request,
        ServerCallContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Saying hello to {Name}", request.Name);
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply 
        {
            Message = "Hello " + request.Name
        });
    }
}
```

`GreeterService` inherits from the `GreeterBase` type, which is generated from the `Greeter` service in the *\*.proto* file. The service is made accessible to clients in *Startup.cs*:

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
});
```

To learn more about gRPC services on ASP.NET Core, see <xref:grpc/aspnetcore>.

## Call gRPC services with a .NET client

gRPC clients are concrete client types that are [generated from *\*.proto* files](xref:grpc/basics#generated-c-assets). The concrete gRPC client has methods that translate to the gRPC service in the *\*.proto* file.

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);

var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(
    new HelloRequest { Name = "World" });

Console.WriteLine(response.Message);
```

A gRPC client is created using a channel, which represents a long-lived connection to a gRPC service. A channel can be created using `GrpcChannel.ForAddress`.

For more information on creating clients, and calling different service methods, see <xref:grpc/client>.
