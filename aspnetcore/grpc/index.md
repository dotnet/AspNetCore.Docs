# Overview for gRPC on .NET

By [James Newton-King](https://twitter.com/jamesnk)

[gRPC](https://grpc.io) is a language agnostic, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

The main benefits of gRPC are:
* Modern, high-performance, lightweight RPC framework.
* Contract-first API development, using Protocol Buffers by default, allowing for language agnostic implementations.
* Tooling available for many languages to generate strongly-typed servers and clients.
* Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming calls.
* Reduced network usage with Protobuf binary serialization.

These benefits make gRPC ideal for:
* Lightweight microservices where efficiency is critical.
* Polyglot systems where multiple languages are required for development.
* Point-to-point real-time services that need to handle streaming requests or responses.

## C# Tooling support for `.proto` files

gRPC uses a contract-first approach to API development. Services and messages are defined in `.proto` files:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

.NET types for services, clients, and messages are automatically generated by including `.proto` files in a project:

* Add a package reference to [Grpc.Tools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Tools/) package.
* Add `.proto` files to the `<Protobuf>` item group.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Protobuf Include="Protos\greet.proto" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## gRPC services on ASP.NET Core

gRPC services can be hosted on ASP.NET Core. Services have full integration with ASP.NET Core features such as logging, dependency injection (DI), authentication, and authorization.

### Add gRPC services to an ASP.NET Core app

gRPC requires the [Grpc.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.AspNetCore) package. For information on configuring gRPC in a .NET app, see [Configure gRPC](xref:grpc/aspnetcore#configure-grpc).

### The gRPC service project template

The **ASP.NET Core gRPC Service** project template provides a starter service:

```csharp
public class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<GreeterService> _logger;

    public GreeterService(ILogger<GreeterService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request,
        ServerCallContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Saying hello to {Name}", request.Name);
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply 
        {
            Message = "Hello " + request.Name
        });
    }
}
```

`GreeterService` inherits from the `GreeterBase` type, which is generated from the `Greeter` service in the `.proto` file. The service is made accessible to clients in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
app.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
```

To learn more about gRPC services on ASP.NET Core, see <xref:grpc/aspnetcore>.

## Call gRPC services with a .NET client

gRPC clients are concrete client types that are [generated from `.proto` files](xref:grpc/basics#generated-c-assets). The concrete gRPC client has methods that translate to the gRPC service in the `.proto` file.

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
var client = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);

var response = await client.SayHelloAsync(
    new HelloRequest { Name = "World" });

Console.WriteLine(response.Message);
```

A gRPC client is created using a channel, which represents a long-lived connection to a gRPC service. A channel can be created using `GrpcChannel.ForAddress`.

For more information on creating clients, and calling different service methods, see <xref:grpc/client>.
