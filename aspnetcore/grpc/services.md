# Create gRPC services and methods

By [James Newton-King](https://twitter.com/jamesnk)

This document explains how to create gRPC services and methods in C#. Topics include:

* How to define services and methods in `.proto` files.
* Generated code using gRPC C# tooling.
* Implementing gRPC services and methods.

## Create new gRPC services

[gRPC services with C#](xref:grpc/basics) introduced gRPC's contract-first approach to API development. Services and messages are defined in `.proto` files. C# tooling then generates code from `.proto` files. For server-side assets, an abstract base type is generated for each service, along with classes for any messages.

The following `.proto` file:

* Defines a `Greeter` service.
* The `Greeter` service defines a `SayHello` call.
* `SayHello` sends a `HelloRequest` message and receives a `HelloReply` message

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

C# tooling generates the C# `GreeterBase` base type:

```csharp
public abstract partial class GreeterBase
{
    public virtual Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.Unimplemented, ""));
    }
}

public class HelloRequest
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class HelloReply
{
    public string Message { get; set; }
}
```

By default the generated `GreeterBase` doesn't do anything. Its virtual `SayHello` method will return an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error to any clients that call it. For the service to be useful an app must create a concrete implementation of `GreeterBase`:

```csharp
public class GreeterService : GreeterBase
{
    public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply { Message = $"Hello {request.Name}" });
    }
}
```

The `ServerCallContext` gives the context for a server-side call.

The service implementation is registered with the app. If the service is hosted by ASP.NET Core gRPC, it should be added to the routing pipeline with the `MapGrpcService` method.

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();
});
```

See <xref:grpc/aspnetcore> for more information.

## Implement gRPC methods

A gRPC service can have different types of methods. How messages are sent and received by a service depends on the type of method defined. The gRPC method types are:

* Unary
* Server streaming
* Client streaming
* Bi-directional streaming

Streaming calls are specified with the `stream` keyword in the `.proto` file. `stream` can be placed on a call's request message, response message, or both.

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service ExampleService {
  // Unary
  rpc UnaryCall (ExampleRequest) returns (ExampleResponse);

  // Server streaming
  rpc StreamingFromServer (ExampleRequest) returns (stream ExampleResponse);

  // Client streaming
  rpc StreamingFromClient (stream ExampleRequest) returns (ExampleResponse);

  // Bi-directional streaming
  rpc StreamingBothWays (stream ExampleRequest) returns (stream ExampleResponse);
}
```

Each call type has a different method signature. Overriding generated methods from the abstract base service type in a concrete implementation ensures the correct arguments and return type are used.

### Unary method

A unary method gets the request message as a parameter, and returns the response. A unary call is complete when the response is returned.

```csharp
public override Task<ExampleResponse> UnaryCall(ExampleRequest request,
    ServerCallContext context)
{
    var response = new ExampleResponse();
    return Task.FromResult(response);
}
```

Unary calls are the most similar to [actions on web API controllers](xref:web-api/index). One important difference gRPC methods have from actions is gRPC methods are not able to bind parts of a request to different method arguments. gRPC methods always have one message argument for the incoming request data. Multiple values can still be sent to a gRPC service by making them fields on the request message:

```protobuf
message ExampleRequest {
    int32 pageIndex = 1;
    int32 pageSize = 2;
    bool isDescending = 3;
}
```

### Server streaming method

A server streaming method gets the request message as a parameter. Because multiple messages can be streamed back to the caller, `responseStream.WriteAsync` is used to send response messages. A server streaming call is complete when the method returns.

```csharp
public override async Task StreamingFromServer(ExampleRequest request,
    IServerStreamWriter<ExampleResponse> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        await responseStream.WriteAsync(new ExampleResponse());
        await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
    }
}
```

The client has no way to send additional messages or data once the server streaming method has started. Some streaming methods are designed to run forever. For continuous streaming methods, a client can cancel the call when it's no longer needed. When cancellation happens the client sends a signal to the server and the [ServerCallContext.CancellationToken](xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken) is raised. The `CancellationToken` token should be used on the server with async methods so that:

* Any asynchronous work is canceled together with the streaming call.
* The method exits quickly.

```csharp
public override async Task StreamingFromServer(ExampleRequest request,
    IServerStreamWriter<ExampleResponse> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    while (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        await responseStream.WriteAsync(new ExampleResponse());
        await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), context.CancellationToken);
    }
}
```

### Client streaming method

A client streaming method starts *without* the method receiving a message. The `requestStream` parameter is used to read messages from the client. A client streaming call is complete when a response message is returned:

```csharp
public override async Task<ExampleResponse> StreamingFromClient(
    IAsyncStreamReader<ExampleRequest> requestStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    while (await requestStream.MoveNext())
    {
        var message = requestStream.Current;
        // ...
    }
    return new ExampleResponse();
}
```

When using C# 8 or later, the `await foreach` syntax can be used to read messages. The `IAsyncStreamReader<T>.ReadAllAsync()` extension method reads all messages from the request stream:

```csharp
public override async Task<ExampleResponse> StreamingFromClient(
    IAsyncStreamReader<ExampleRequest> requestStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    await foreach (var message in requestStream.ReadAllAsync())
    {
        // ...
    }
    return new ExampleResponse();
}
```

### Bi-directional streaming method

A bi-directional streaming method starts *without* the method receiving a message. The `requestStream` parameter is used to read messages from the client. The method can choose to send messages with `responseStream.WriteAsync`. A bi-directional streaming call is complete when the method returns:

```csharp
public override async Task StreamingBothWays(IAsyncStreamReader<ExampleRequest> requestStream,
    IServerStreamWriter<ExampleResponse> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    await foreach (var message in requestStream.ReadAllAsync())
    {
        await responseStream.WriteAsync(new ExampleResponse());
    }
}
```

The preceding code:

* Sends a response for each request.
* Is a basic usage of bi-directional streaming.

It is possible to support more complex scenarios, such as reading requests and sending responses simultaneously:

```csharp
public override async Task StreamingBothWays(IAsyncStreamReader<ExampleRequest> requestStream,
    IServerStreamWriter<ExampleResponse> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    // Read requests in a background task.
    var readTask = Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        await foreach (var message in requestStream.ReadAllAsync())
        {
            // Process request.
        }
    });
    
    // Send responses until the client signals that it is complete.
    while (!readTask.IsCompleted)
    {
        await responseStream.WriteAsync(new ExampleResponse());
        await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), context.CancellationToken);
    }
}
```

In a bi-directional streaming method, the client and service can send messages to each other at any time. The best implementation of a bi-directional method varies depending upon requirements.

## Access gRPC request headers

A request message is not the only way for a client to send data to a gRPC service. Header values are available in a service using `ServerCallContext.RequestHeaders`.

```csharp
public override Task<ExampleResponse> UnaryCall(ExampleRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
{
    var userAgent = context.RequestHeaders.GetValue("user-agent");
    // ...

    return Task.FromResult(new ExampleResponse());
}
```
