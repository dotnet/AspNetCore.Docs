# Code-first gRPC services and clients with .NET

Code-first gRPC uses .NET types to define service and message contracts.

Code-first is a good choice when an entire system uses .NET:

* .NET service and data contract types can be shared between the .NET server and clients.
* Avoids the need to define contracts in `.proto` files and code generation.

Code-first isn't recommended in polyglot systems with multiple languages. .NET service and data contract types can't be used with non-.NET platforms. To call a gRPC service written using code-first, other platforms must create a `.proto` contract that matches the service.

## protobuf-net.Grpc

[protobuf-net.Grpc](https://protobuf-net.github.io/protobuf-net.Grpc/) is a community project and isn't supported by Microsoft. It adds code-first support to `Grpc.AspNetCore` and `Grpc.Net.Client`. It uses .NET types annotated with attributes to define an app's gRPC services and messages.

The first step to creating a code-first gRPC service is defining the code contract:

* Create a new project that will be shared by the server and client.
* Add a [protobuf-net.Grpc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net.Grpc) package reference.
* Create service and data contract types.

[!code-csharp[](code-first/samples/6.x/Shared/Contracts.cs)]

The preceding code:

* Defines `HelloRequest` and `HelloReply` messages.
* Defines the `IGreeterService` contract interface with the unary `SayHelloAsync` gRPC method.

The service contract is implemented on the server and called from the client.

Methods defined on service interfaces must match certain signatures depending on whether they're:

* Unary
* Server streaming
* Client streaming
* Bidirectional streaming

For more information on defining service contracts, see the [protobuf-net.Grpc getting started documentation](https://protobuf-net.github.io/protobuf-net.Grpc/gettingstarted).

## Create a code-first gRPC service

To add gRPC code-first service to an ASP.NET Core app:

* Add a [protobuf-net.Grpc.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net.Grpc.AspNetCore) package reference.
* Add a reference to the shared code-contract project.

  [!code-xml[](code-first/samples/6.x/GrpcGreeter/GrpcGreeter.csproj?highlight=9-11,13-15)]

* Create a new `GreeterService.cs` file and implement the `IGreeterService` service interface:

  [!code-csharp[](code-first/samples/6.x/GrpcGreeter/Services/GreeterService.cs?highlight=4)]

* Update the `Program.cs` file:

  [!code-csharp[](code-first/samples/6.x/GrpcGreeter/Program.cs?highlight=9,14)]

  The preceding highlighted code updates the following:

  * `AddCodeFirstGrpc` registers services that enable code-first.
  * `MapGrpcService<GreeterService>` adds the code-first service endpoint.

gRPC services implemented with code-first and `.proto` files can co-exist in the same app. All gRPC services use [gRPC service configuration](xref:grpc/configuration#configure-services-options).

## Create a code-first gRPC client

A code-first gRPC client uses the service contract to call gRPC services.

* In the gRPC client `.csproj` file:

  * Add a [protobuf-net.Grpc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net.Grpc) package reference.
  * Add a [Grpc.Net.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Net.Client) package reference.
  * Add a reference to the shared code-contract project.

  [!code-csharp[](code-first/samples/6.x/GrpcGreeterClient/GrpcGreeterClient.csproj?highlight=10-13,15-17)]

[!code-xml[](code-first/samples/6.x/GrpcGreeterClient/GrpcGreeterClient.csproj?highlight=10-13,15-17)]

* Update the client `program.cs`

  [!code-csharp[](code-first/samples/6.x/GrpcGreeterClient/Program.cs?highlight=13,15-16)]

The preceding gRPC client `Program.cs` code:

* Creates a gRPC channel.
* Creates a code-first client from the channel with the `CreateGrpcService<IGreeterService>` extension method.
* Calls the gRPC service with `SayHelloAsync`.

A code-first gRPC client is created from a channel. Just like a regular client, a code-first client uses its [channel configuration](xref:grpc/configuration#configure-client-options).
