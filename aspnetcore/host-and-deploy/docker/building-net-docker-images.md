# Run an ASP.NET Core app in Docker containers

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This article shows how to run an ASP.NET Core app in Docker containers.

Windows Home Edition doesn't support Hyper-V, and Hyper-V is needed for Docker.

See [Containerize a .NET app with dotnet publish](/dotnet/core/docker/publish-as-container) for information on containerized a .NET app with `dotnet publish`.
