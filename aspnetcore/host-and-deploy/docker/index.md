# Host ASP.NET Core in Docker containers

The following articles are available for learning about hosting ASP.NET Core apps in Docker:

[Introduction to Containers and Docker](/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/container-docker-introduction/index)  
See how containerization is an approach to software development in which an application or service, its dependencies, and its configuration are packaged together as a container image. The image can be tested and then deployed to a host.

[What is Docker](/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/container-docker-introduction/docker-defined)  
Discover how Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of apps as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.

[Docker Terminology](/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/container-docker-introduction/docker-terminology)  
Learn terms and definitions for Docker technology.

[Docker containers, images, and registries](/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/container-docker-introduction/docker-containers-images-registries)  
Find out how Docker container images are stored in an image registry for consistent deployment across environments.

[Building Docker Images for .NET Core Applications](/dotnet/articles/core/docker/building-net-docker-images)  
Learn how to build and dockerize an ASP.NET Core app. Explore Docker images maintained by Microsoft and examine use cases.

[Visual Studio Tools for Docker](xref:host-and-deploy/docker/visual-studio-tools-for-docker)  
Discover how Visual Studio 2017 supports building, debugging, and running ASP.NET Core apps targeting either .NET Framework or .NET Core on Docker for Windows. Both Windows and Linux containers are supported.

[Publish to a Docker Image](/azure/vs-azure-tools-docker-hosting-web-apps-in-docker)  
Find out how to use the Visual Studio Tools for Docker extension to deploy an ASP.NET Core app to a Docker host on Azure using PowerShell.
