# Deploy ASP.NET Core apps to Azure App Service

[Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) is a [Microsoft cloud computing platform service](https://azure.microsoft.com/) for hosting web apps, including ASP.NET Core.

## Useful resources

[App Service Documentation](/azure/app-service/) is the home for Azure Apps documentation, tutorials, samples, how-to guides, and other resources. Two notable tutorials that pertain to hosting ASP.NET Core apps are:

[Create an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet)  
Use Visual Studio to create and deploy an ASP.NET Core web app to Azure App Service on Windows.

[Create an ASP.NET Core app in App Service on Linux](/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-dotnetcore)  
Use the command line to create and deploy an ASP.NET Core web app to Azure App Service on Linux.

See the [ASP.NET Core on App Service Dashboard](https://aspnetcoreon.azurewebsites.net/) for the version of ASP.NET Core available on Azure App service.

Subscribe to the [App Service Announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/) repository and monitor the issues. The App Service team regularly posts announcements and scenarios arriving in App Service.

The following articles are available in ASP.NET Core documentation:

<xref:tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs>  
Learn how to publish an ASP.NET Core app to Azure App Service using Visual Studio.

[Create your first pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started-yaml)  
Set up a CI build for an ASP.NET Core app, then create a continuous deployment release to Azure App Service.

Discover Azure App Service runtime execution limitations enforced by the Azure Apps platform.

<xref:test/troubleshoot>  
Understand and troubleshoot warnings and errors with ASP.NET Core projects.

## Application configuration

### Platform

The platform architecture (x86/x64) of an App Services app is set in the app's settings in the Azure Portal for apps that are hosted on an A-series compute (Basic) or higher hosting tier. Confirm that the app's publish settings (for example, in the Visual Studio [publish profile (.pubxml)](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles)) match the setting in the app's service configuration in the Azure Portal.

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.2"

Runtimes for 64-bit (x64) and 32-bit (x86) apps are present on Azure App Service. The [.NET Core SDK](/dotnet/core/sdk) available on App Service is 32-bit, but you can deploy 64-bit apps built locally using the [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki) console or the publish process in Visual Studio. For more information, see the [Publish and deploy the app](#publish-and-deploy-the-app) section.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.2"

For apps with native dependencies, runtimes for 32-bit (x86) apps are present on Azure App Service. The [.NET Core SDK](/dotnet/core/sdk) available on App Service is 32-bit.

:::moniker-end

For more information on .NET Core framework components and distribution methods, such as information on the .NET Core runtime and the .NET Core SDK, see [About .NET Core: Composition](/dotnet/core/about#composition).

### Packages

Include the following NuGet packages to provide automatic logging features for apps deployed to Azure App Service:

* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServices.HostingStartup](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServices.HostingStartup/) uses [IHostingStartup](xref:fundamentals/configuration/platform-specific-configuration) to provide ASP.NET Core logging integration with Azure App Service. The added logging features are provided by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServicesIntegration` package.
* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServicesIntegration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServicesIntegration/) executes <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServicesLoggerFactoryExtensions.AddAzureWebAppDiagnostics%2A> to add Azure App Service diagnostics logging providers in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices` package.
* [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices/) provides logger implementations to support Azure App Service diagnostics logs and log streaming features.

The preceding packages must be explicitly referenced in the app's project file.

## Override app configuration using the Azure Portal

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-3.0"

App settings in the Azure Portal permit you to set environment variables for the app. Environment variables can be consumed by the [Environment Variables Configuration Provider](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index#environment-variables).

When an app setting is created or modified in the Azure Portal and the **Save** button is selected, the Azure App is restarted. The environment variable is available to the app after the service restarts.

When an app uses the [Generic Host](xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host), environment variables are loaded into the app's configuration when <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Host.CreateDefaultBuilder%2A> is called to build the host. For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host> and the [Environment Variables Configuration Provider](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index#environment-variables).

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-3.0"

App settings in the Azure Portal permit you to set environment variables for the app. Environment variables can be consumed by the [Environment Variables Configuration Provider](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index#evcp).

When an app setting is created or modified in the Azure Portal and the **Save** button is selected, the Azure App is restarted. The environment variable is available to the app after the service restarts.

When an app uses the [Web Host](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host), environment variables are loaded into the app's configuration when <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder%2A> is called to build the host. For more information, see <xref:fundamentals/host/web-host> and the [Environment Variables Configuration Provider](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index#evcp).

:::moniker-end

## Proxy server and load balancer scenarios

The [IIS Integration Middleware](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index#enable-the-iisintegration-components), which configures Forwarded Headers Middleware when hosting [out-of-process](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index#out-of-process-hosting-model), and the ASP.NET Core Module are configured to forward the scheme (HTTP/HTTPS) and the remote IP address where the request originated. Additional configuration might be required for apps hosted behind additional proxy servers and load balancers. For more information, see [Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers](xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer).

## Monitoring and logging

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-3.0"

ASP.NET Core apps deployed to App Service automatically receive an App Service extension, **ASP.NET Core Logging Integration**. The extension enables logging integration for ASP.NET Core apps on Azure App Service.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="< aspnetcore-3.0"

ASP.NET Core apps deployed to App Service automatically receive an App Service extension, **ASP.NET Core Logging Extensions**. The extension enables logging integration for ASP.NET Core apps on Azure App Service.

## Data Protection key ring and deployment slots

[Data Protection keys](xref:security/data-protection/implementation/key-management#data-protection-implementation-key-management) are persisted to the *%HOME%\ASP.NET\DataProtection-Keys* folder. This folder is backed by network storage and is synchronized across all machines hosting the app. Keys aren't protected at rest. This folder supplies the key ring to all instances of an app in a single deployment slot. Separate deployment slots, such as Staging and Production, don't share a key ring.

When swapping between deployment slots, any system using data protection won't be able to decrypt stored data using the key ring inside the previous slot. ASP.NET Cookie Middleware uses data protection to protect its cookies. This leads to users being signed out of an app that uses the standard ASP.NET Cookie Middleware. For a slot-independent key ring solution, use an external key ring provider, such as:

* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Key Vault
* SQL store
* Redis cache

For more information, see <xref:security/data-protection/implementation/key-storage-providers>.

## Deploy an ASP.NET Core app that uses a .NET Core preview

To deploy an app that uses a preview release of .NET Core, see the following resources. These approaches are also used when the runtime is available but the SDK hasn't been installed on Azure App Service.

* [Specify the .NET Core SDK Version using Azure Pipelines](#specify-the-net-core-sdk-version-using-azure-pipelines)
* [Deploy a self-contained preview app](#deploy-a-self-contained-preview-app)
* [Use Docker with Web Apps for containers](#use-docker-with-web-apps-for-containers)
* [Install the preview site extension](#install-the-preview-site-extension)

See the [ASP.NET Core on App Service Dashboard](https://aspnetcoreon.azurewebsites.net/) for the version of ASP.NET Core available on Azure App service.

See [Select the .NET Core version to use](/dotnet/core/versions/selection) for information on selecting the version of the .NET SDK for self-contained deployments.

### Specify the .NET Core SDK Version using Azure Pipelines

Use [Azure App Service CI/CD scenarios](/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment) to set up a continuous integration build with Azure DevOps. After the Azure DevOps build is created, optionally configure the build to use a specific SDK version. 

#### Specify the .NET Core SDK version

When using the App Service deployment center to create an Azure DevOps build, the default build pipeline includes steps for `Restore`, `Build`, `Test`, and `Publish`. To specify the SDK version, select the **Add (+)** button in the Agent job list to add a new step. Search for **.NET Core SDK** in the search bar. 

![Add the .NET Core SDK step](index/add-sdk-step.png)

Move the step into the first position in the build so that the steps following it use the specified version of the .NET Core SDK. Specify the version of the .NET Core SDK. In this example, the SDK is set to `3.0.100`.

![Completed SDK step](index/sdk-step-first-place.png)

To publish a [self-contained deployment (SCD)](/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd), configure SCD in the `Publish` step and provide the [Runtime Identifier (RID)](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).

![Self-contained publish](index/self-contained.png)

### Deploy a self-contained preview app

A [self-contained deployment (SCD)](/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) that targets a preview runtime carries the preview runtime in the deployment.

When deploying a self-contained app:

* The site in Azure App Service doesn't require the [preview site extension](#install-the-preview-site-extension).
* The app must be published following a different approach than when publishing for a [framework-dependent deployment (FDD)](/dotnet/core/deploying#framework-dependent-deployments-fdd).

Follow the guidance in the [Deploy the app self-contained](#deploy-the-app-self-contained) section.

### Use Docker with Web Apps for containers

The [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/) contains the latest preview Docker images. The images can be used as a base image. Use the image and deploy to Web Apps for Containers normally.

### Install the preview site extension

If a problem occurs using the preview site extension, open an [dotnet/AspNetCore issue](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues).

1. From the Azure Portal, navigate to the App Service.
1. Select the web app.
1. Type "ex" in the search box to filter for "Extensions" or scroll down the list of management tools.
1. Select **Extensions**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select the **ASP.NET Core {X.Y} ({x64|x86}) Runtime** extension from the list, where `{X.Y}` is the ASP.NET Core preview version and `{x64|x86}` specifies the platform.
1. Select **OK** to accept the legal terms.
1. Select **OK** to install the extension.

When the operation completes, the latest .NET Core preview is installed. Verify the installation:

1. Select **Advanced Tools**.
1. Select **Go** in **Advanced Tools**.
1. Select the **Debug console** > **PowerShell** menu item.
1. At the PowerShell prompt, execute the following command. Substitute the ASP.NET Core runtime version for `{X.Y}` and the platform for `{PLATFORM}` in the command:

   ```powershell
   Test-Path D:\home\SiteExtensions\AspNetCoreRuntime.{X.Y}.{PLATFORM}\
   ```

   The command returns `True` when the x64 preview runtime is installed.

> [!NOTE]
> The platform architecture (x86/x64) of an App Services app is set in the app's settings in the Azure Portal for apps that are hosted on an A-series compute (Basic) or higher hosting tier. Confirm that the app's publish settings (for example, in the Visual Studio [publish profile (.pubxml)](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles)) match the setting in the app's service configuration in the Azure portal.
>
> If the app is run in in-process mode and the platform architecture is configured for 64-bit (x64), the ASP.NET Core Module uses the 64-bit preview runtime, if present. Install the **ASP.NET Core {X.Y} (x64) Runtime** extension using the Azure Portal.
>
> After installing the x64 preview runtime, run the following command in the Azure Kudu PowerShell command window to verify the installation. Substitute the ASP.NET Core runtime version for `{X.Y}` in the following command:
>
> ```powershell
> Test-Path D:\home\SiteExtensions\AspNetCoreRuntime.{X.Y}.x64\
> ```
>
> The command returns `True` when the x64 preview runtime is installed.

> [!NOTE]
> **ASP.NET Core Extensions** enables additional functionality for ASP.NET Core on Azure App Services, such as enabling Azure logging. The extension is installed automatically when deploying from Visual Studio. If the extension isn't installed, install it for the app.

**Use the preview site extension with an ARM template**

If an ARM template is used to create and deploy apps, the `Microsoft.Web/sites/siteextensions` resource type can be used to add the site extension to a web app. In the following example, the ASP.NET Core 5.0 (x64) Runtime site extension (`AspNetCoreRuntime.5.0.x64`) is added to the app:

[!code-json[](index/sample/arm.json)]

For the placeholder `{SITE NAME}`, use the app's name in Azure App Service (for example, `contoso`).

## Publish and deploy the app

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.2"

For a 64-bit deployment:

* Use a 64-bit .NET Core SDK to build a 64-bit app.
* Set the **Platform** to **64 Bit** in the App Service's **Configuration** > **General settings**. The app must use a Basic or higher service plan to enable the choice of platform bitness.

:::moniker-end

### Deploy the app framework-dependent

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

1. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Publish**. Alternatively, select **Build** > **Publish {Application Name}** from the Visual Studio toolbar.
1. In the **Publish** dialog, select **Azure** > **Next**.
1. Select the Azure service.
1. Select **Advanced**. The **Publish** dialog opens.
1. Select a Resource group and Hosting plan, or create new ones.
1. Select **Finish**.
1. In the **Publish** page:
   * For **Configuration**, select the pen icon **Edit Configuration**:   
      * Confirm that the **Release** configuration is selected.
      * In the **Deployment Mode** drop-down list, select  **Framework-Dependent**.
      * In the **Target Runtime** drop-down list, select the desired runtime. The default is `win-x86`.
    * To remove additional files upon deployment, open **File Publish Options** and select the checkbox to remove additional files at the destination.
   * Select **Save**.
   * Select **Publish**.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli/)

1. In the project file, don't specify a [Runtime Identifier (RID)](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).

1. From a command shell, publish the app in Release configuration with the [dotnet publish](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) command. In the following example, the app is published as a framework-dependent app:

   ```console
   dotnet publish --configuration Release
   ```

1. Move the contents of the *bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish* directory to the site in App Service. If dragging the *publish* folder contents from your local hard drive or network share directly to App Service in the [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki) console, drag the files to the `D:\home\site\wwwroot` folder in the Kudu console.

---

### Deploy the app self-contained

Use Visual Studio or the .NET Core CLI for a [self-contained deployment (SCD)](/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd).

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

1. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Publish**. Alternatively, select **Build** > **Publish {Application Name}** from the Visual Studio toolbar.
1. In the **Publish** dialog, select **Azure** > **Next**.
1. Select the Azure service.
1. Select **Advanced**. The **Publish** dialog opens.
1. Select a Resource group and Hosting plan, or create new ones.
1. Select **Finish**.
1. In the **Publish** page:
   * For **Configuration**, select the pen icon **Edit Configuration**:   
      * Confirm that the **Release** configuration is selected.
      * In the **Deployment Mode** drop-down list, select **Self-Contained**.
      * In the **Target Runtime** drop-down list, select the desired runtime. The default is `win-x86`.
    * To remove additional files upon deployment, open **File Publish Options** and select the checkbox to remove additional files at the destination.
   * Select **Save**.
   * Select **Publish**.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli/)

1. In the project file, specify one or more [Runtime Identifiers (RIDs)](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog). Use `<RuntimeIdentifier>` for a single RID, or use `<RuntimeIdentifiers>` to provide a semicolon-delimited list of multiple RIDs. In the following example, the `win-x86` RID is specified:

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <TargetFramework>{TARGET FRAMEWORK}</TargetFramework>
     <RuntimeIdentifier>win-x86</RuntimeIdentifier>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

1. From a command shell, publish the app in Release configuration for the host's runtime with the [dotnet publish](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) command. In the following example, the app is published for the `win-x86` RID. The RID supplied to the `--runtime` option must be provided in the `<RuntimeIdentifier>` (or `<RuntimeIdentifiers>`) property in the project file.

   ```console
   dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime win-x86 --self-contained
   ```

1. Move the contents of the *bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/{RUNTIME IDENTIFIER}/publish* directory to the site in App Service. If dragging the *publish* folder contents from your local hard drive or network share directly to App Service in the [Kudu console](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki), drag the files to the `D:\home\site\wwwroot` folder in the Kudu console.

## Protocol settings (HTTPS)

Secure protocol bindings allow specifying a certificate to use when responding to requests over HTTPS. Binding requires a valid private certificate (*.pfx*) issued for the specific hostname. For more information, see [Tutorial: Bind an existing custom SSL certificate to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl).

## Transform web.config

If you need to transform *web.config* on publish (for example, set environment variables based on the configuration, profile, or environment), see <xref:host-and-deploy/iis/transform-webconfig>.
