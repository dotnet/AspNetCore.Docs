# Migrate from ASP.NET Core 2.2 to 3.0

By [Scott Addie](https://github.com/scottaddie)

This article explains how to update an existing ASP.NET Core 2.2 project to ASP.NET Core 3.0 Preview.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-core-prereqs-all-3.0.md)]

## Update the project file

* Set the [Target Framework Moniker (TFM)](/dotnet/standard/frameworks#referring-to-frameworks) to `netcoreapp3.0`:

  ```xml
  <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>
  ```

* Remove the `<PackageReference>` to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`.

  **Preview 1 Known Issue** - workaround for [NuGet/Home #7342](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7342) - projects that do not start with `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">` will get compiler or runtime errors due to missing Microsoft.AspNetCore.* assemblies. This is most often the case for test projects and class libraries. The workaround is to add the following to the *.csproj* file.

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
     <FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

* Update the `Version` on remaining `<PackageReference>` elements for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.*` packages to the current preview (for example, 3.0.0-preview-18579-0053).

  If there is no 3.0 version of a package, the package might have been deprecated in 3.0. Many of these are part of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` and should not be referenced individually anymore. For a preliminary list of packages no longer produced in 3.0, see [aspnet/AspNetCore #3756](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3756).

* Some assemblies were removed from Microsoft.AspNetCore.App between 2.x and 3.0. You may need to add `<PackageReference>` items if you're using APIs from packages listed in [aspnet/AspNetCore #3755](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3755)

  For example, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` and `System.Data.SqlClient` are no longer part of Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.

  **Preview 1 Known Issue** - the list of assemblies shipping in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` has not been finalized yet and will change before 3.0 RTM.
