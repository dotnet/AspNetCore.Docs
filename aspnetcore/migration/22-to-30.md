# Migrate from ASP.NET Core 2.2 to 3.0

By [Scott Addie](https://github.com/scottaddie) and [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

This article explains how to update an existing ASP.NET Core 2.2 project to ASP.NET Core 3.0.

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-core-prereqs-all-3.0.md)]

## Update the project file

* Set the [Target Framework Moniker (TFM)](/dotnet/standard/frameworks#referring-to-frameworks) to `netcoreapp3.0`:

  ```xml
  <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>
  ```

* Remove any `<PackageReference>` to the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.All](xref:fundamentals/metapackage) or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App](xref:fundamentals/metapackage-app) metapackage.

* Update the `Version` on remaining `<PackageReference>` elements for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.*` packages to the current preview (for example, `3.0.0-preview-18579-0053`).

  If there's no 3.0 version of a package, the package might have been deprecated in 3.0. Many of these are part of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` and shouldn't be referenced individually. For a preliminary list of packages no longer produced in 3.0, see [Stop producing packages for shared framework assemblies in 3.0 (aspnet/AspNetCore #3756)](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3756). The *shared framework* is the set of assemblies (*.dll* files) that are installed on the machine and referenced by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`. For more information, see [The shared framework](https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2018/08/29/netcore-primitives-2/).

* Some assemblies were removed from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` between 2.x and 3.0. You may need to add `<PackageReference>` items if you're using APIs from packages listed in [Assemblies being removed from Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0 (aspnet/AspNetCore #3755)](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3755).

  For example, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` and `System.Data.SqlClient` are no longer part of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`. The list of assemblies shipping in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` hasn't been finalized yet and will change before 3.0 RTM.

* Add [Json.NET support](#jsonnet-support).

* Projects default to the [in-process hosting model](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module#in-process-hosting-model) in ASP.NET Core 3.0 or later. You may optionally remove the `<AspNetCoreHostingModel>` property in the project file if its value is `InProcess`.

## Json.NET support

As part of the work to [improve the ASP.NET Core shared framework](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/10/29/a-first-look-at-changes-coming-in-asp-net-core-3-0/), [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Introduction.htm) has been removed from the ASP.NET Core shared framework.

To use Json.NET in an ASP.NET Core 3.0 project:

* Add a package reference to [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson).
* Update `Startup.ConfigureServices` to call `AddNewtonsoftJson()`.

  ```csharp
  services.AddMvc()
      .AddNewtonsoftJson();
  ```

  Newtonsoft settings can be set with `AddNewtonsoftJson`:

  ```csharp
  services.AddMvc()
      .AddNewtonsoftJson(options =>
             options.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver =
                new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver());
  ```

## MVC service registration

ASP.NET Core 3.0 adds new options for registering MVC scenarios inside `Startup.ConfigureServices`.

Three new top-level extension methods related to MVC scenarios on `IServiceCollection` are available. Templates use these new methods instead of `UseMvc`. However, `AddMvc` continues to behave as it has in previous releases.

The following example adds support for controllers and API-related features, but not views or pages. The API template uses this code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
}
```

The following example adds support for controllers, API-related features, and views, but not pages. The Web Application (MVC) template uses this code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}
```

The following example adds support for Razor Pages and minimal controller support. The Web Application template uses this code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages();
}
```

The new methods can also be combined. The following example is equivalent to calling `AddMvc` in ASP.NET Core 2.2: 

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddRazorPages();
}
```

## Update routing startup code

If an app calls `UseMvc` or `UseSignalR`, migrate the app to [Endpoint Routing](xref:fundamentals/routing) if possible. To improve Endpoint Routing compatibility with previous versions of MVC, we've reverted some of the changes in URL generation introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.2. If you experienced problems using Endpoint Routing in 2.2, expect improvements in ASP.NET Core 3.0 with the following exceptions:

* If the app implements `IRouter` or inherits from `Route`, you may want to avoid migrating at this time. Provide feedback at [Plan to migrate IRouter based implementations onto Endpoint Routing](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4221).

* If the app directly accesses `RouteData.Routers` inside MVC, you may want to avoid migrating at this time. Provide feedback at [Migration guidance for using RouteData.Routers](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/9148).

Endpoint Routing supports the same route pattern syntax and route pattern authoring features as `IRouter`. Endpoint Routing supports `IRouteContraint`. Endpoint routing supports `[Route]`, `[HttpGet]`, and the other MVC routing attributes.

For most applications, only `Startup` requires changes.

### Migrate Startup.Configure

General advice:

* Add `UseRouting`. 
* If the app calls `UseStaticFiles`, place `UseStaticFiles` **before** `UseRouting`.
* If the app uses authentication/authorization features such as `AuthorizePage` or `[Authorize]`, place the call to `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization` **after** `UseRouting`.
* If the app uses [CORS](xref:security/cors) features, such as `[EnableCors]`, place `UseCors` next.
* Replace `UseMvc` or `UseSignalR` with `UseEndpoints`.

The following is an example of `Startup.Configure` in a typical ASP.NET Core 2.2 app:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseStaticFiles();
    
    app.UseAuthentication();

    app.UseSignalR(hubs =>
    {
        hubs.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chat");
    });

    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute("default", "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

After updating the previous `Startup.Configure` code:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseStaticFiles();
    
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.UseCors();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chat");
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute("default", "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

### Security middleware guidance

Support for authorization and CORS is unified around the [middleware](xref:fundamentals/middleware/index) approach. This allows use of the same middleware and functionality across these scenarios. An updated authorization middleware is provided in this release, and CORS middleware is enhanced so that it can understand the attributes used by MVC controllers.

#### CORS

Previously, CORS could be difficult to configure. Middleware was provided for use in some use cases, but MVC filters were intended to be used **without** the middleware in other use cases. With ASP.NET Core 3.0, we recommend that all apps that require CORS use the CORS middleware in tandem with Endpoint Routing. `UseCors` can be provided with a default policy, and `[EnableCors]` and `[DisableCors]` attributes can be used to override the default policy where required. 

In the following example:

* CORS is enabled for all endpoints with the `default` named policy.
* The `MyController` class disables CORS with the `[DisableCors]` attribute.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseCors("default"); 

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
    });
}

[DisableCors]
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    ...
}
```

#### Authorization

In earlier versions of ASP.NET Core, authorization support was provided via the `[Authorize]` attribute. Authorization middleware wasn't available. In ASP.NET Core 3.0, authorization middleware is required. We recommend placing the authorization middleware (`UseAuthentication`) immediately before `UseAuthorization`. Authorization middleware can also be configured with a default policy, which can be overridden.

In ASP.NET Core 3.0 or later, `UseAuthorization` is called in `Startup.Configure`, and the following `HomeController` requires a signed in user:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
    });
}

public class HomeController : ControllerBase
{
    [Authorize]
    public IActionResult BuyWidgets()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

If the app uses an `AuthorizeFilter` as a global filter in MVC, we recommend refactoring the code to provide a policy to the `UseAuthorization` middleware.

In the following example, a custom policy to be applied to all requests when `UseAuthorization` is called, and the `HomeController` allows access without the user signing into the app:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization(new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder().Build()));

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
    });
}

[AllowAnonymous]
public class HomeController : ControllerBase
{
    ...
}
```

Authorization by middleware works without the framework having any specific knowledge of authorization. For instance, [health checks](xref:host-and-deploy/health-checks) has no specific knowledge of authorization, but health checks can have a configurable authorization policy applied by the middleware.

In the following example, `UseAuthorization` processes authorization without a default policy, but the `/healthz` health check endpoint requires the user to be in the `admin` role: 

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints
            .MapHealthChecks("/healthz")
            .RequireAuthorization(new AuthorizeAttribute(){ Roles = "admin", });
    });
}
```

Protection is implemented for some scenarios. `UseEndpoint` middleware throws an exception if an authorization or CORS policy is skipped due to missing middleware. Analyzer support to provide additional feedback about misconfiguration is in progress.

### Migrate SignalR

Mapping of SignalR hubs now takes place inside `UseEndpoints`. 

Map each hub with `MapHub`. As in previous versions, each hub is explicitly listed.

In the following example, support for the `ChatHub` SignalR hub is added:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>();
    });
}
```

### Migrate MVC controllers

Mapping of controllers now takes place inside `UseEndpoints`. 

Add `MapControllers` if the app uses attribute routing. Since routing includes support for many frameworks in ASP.NET Core 3.0 or later, adding attribute-routed controllers is opt-in. 

Replace the following:

* `MapRoute` with `MapControllerRoute`
* `MapAreaRoute` with `MapAreaControllerRoute`

Since routing now includes support for more than just MVC, the terminology has changed to make these methods clearly state what they do. Conventional routes such as `MapControllerRoute`/`MapAreaControllerRoute`/`MapDefaultControllerRoute` are applied in the order that they're added. Place more specific routes (such as routes for an area) first.

In the following example:

* `MapControllers` adds support for attribute-routed controllers.
* `MapAreaControllerRoute` adds a conventional route for controllers in an area.
* `MapControllerRoute` adds a conventional route for controllers.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
        endpoints.MapAreaControllerRoute(
            "admin", 
            "admin", 
            "Admin/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            "default", "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

### Migrate Razor Pages

Mapping Razor Pages now takes place inside `UseEndpoints`.

Add `MapRazorPages` if the app uses Razor Pages. Since Endpoint Routing includes support for many frameworks, adding Razor Pages is now opt-in.

In the following example, `MapRazorPages` adds support for Razor Pages:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
    });
}
```

### Use MVC without Endpoint Routing

Using MVC via `UseMvc` or `UseMvcWithDefaultRoute` in ASP.NET Core 3.0 requires an explicit opt-in inside `Startup.ConfigureServices`. This is required because MVC must know whether it can rely on the authorization and CORS middleware during initialization. An analyzer is provided that warns if the app attempts to use an unsupported configuration.

If the app requires legacy `IRouter` support, disable `EnableEndpointRouting` using any of the following approaches in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddMvc(options => options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);
```

```csharp
services.AddControllers(options => options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);
```

```csharp
services.AddControllersWithViews(options => options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);

```

```csharp
services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options => options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);
```

### Migrate health checks

Health checks can be used as a *router-ware* with Endpoint Routing.

Add `MapHealthChecks` to use health checks with Endpoint Routing. The `MapHealthChecks` method accepts arguments similar to `UseHealthChecks`. The advantage of using `MapHealthChecks` over `UseHealthChecks` is the ability to apply authorization and to have greater fine-grained control over the matching policy. 

In the following example, `MapHealthChecks` is called for a health check endpoint at `/healthz`:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    ...

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/healthz", new HealthCheckOptions() { });
    });
}
```

## HostBuilder replaces WebHostBuilder

The ASP.NET Core 3.0 templates use [Generic Host](xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host). Previous versions used [Web Host](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host). The following code shows the ASP.NET Core 3.0 template generated `Program` class:

[!code-csharp[](22-to-30/samples/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

The following code shows the ASP.NET Core 2.2 template-generated `Program` class:

[!code-csharp[](22-to-30/samples/Program2.2.cs?name=snippet)]

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostBuilder> remains in 3.0 and is the type of the `webBuilder` seen in the preceding code sample. <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WebHostBuilder> will be deprecated in a future release and replaced by `HostBuilder`.

The most significant change from `WebHostBuilder` to `HostBuilder` is in [dependency injection (DI)](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection). When using `HostBuilder`, you can only inject <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration> and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IHostingEnvironment> into `Startup`'s constructor. The `HostBuilder` DI constraints:

* Enable the DI container to be built only one time.
* Avoids the resulting object lifetime issues like resolving multiple instances of singletons.

## Update SignalR code

`System.Text.Json` is now the default Hub Protocol used by both the client and server.

In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, call `AddJsonProtocol` to set serializer options.

**Server:**

```csharp
services.AddSignalR(...)
        .AddJsonProtocol(options =>
        {
            options.WriteIndented = false;
        })
```

**Client:**

```csharp
new HubConnectionBuilder()
    .WithUrl("/chatHub")
    .AddJsonProtocol(options =>
    {
        options.WriteIndented = false;
    })
    .Build();
```

### Switch to Newtonsoft.Json
If you're using features of `Newtonsoft.Json` that aren't supported in `System.Text.Json`, you can switch back to `Newtonsoft.Json`:

1. Install the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.NewtonsoftJson](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.NewtonsoftJson) NuGet package.
1. On the client, chain an `AddNewtonsoftJsonProtocol` method call to the `HubConnectionBuilder` instance:

```csharp
new HubConnectionBuilder()
    .WithUrl("/chatHub")
    .AddNewtonsoftJsonProtocol(...)
    .Build();
```

3. On the server, chain an `AddNewtonsoftJsonProtocol` method call to the `AddSignalR` method call in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddSignalR()
    .AddNewtonsoftJsonProtocol(...);
```

## Opt in to runtime compilation

In 3.0, runtime compilation is an opt-in scenario. To enable runtime compilation, see <xref:mvc/views/view-compilation#runtime-compilation>.
