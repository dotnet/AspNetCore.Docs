# Migrate from ASP.NET Core 1.x to 2.0

By [Scott Addie](https://github.com/scottaddie)

In this article, we walk you through updating an existing ASP.NET Core 1.x project to ASP.NET Core 2.0. Migrating your application to ASP.NET Core 2.0 enables you to take advantage of [many new features and performance improvements](xref:aspnetcore-2.0).

Existing ASP.NET Core 1.x applications are based off of version-specific project templates. As the ASP.NET Core framework evolves, so do the project templates and the starter code contained within them. In addition to updating the ASP.NET Core framework, you need to update the code for your application.

## Prerequisites

See [Get Started with ASP.NET Core](xref:getting-started).

<a name="tfm"></a>

## Update Target Framework Moniker (TFM)

Projects targeting .NET Core should use the [TFM](/dotnet/standard/frameworks) of a version greater than or equal to .NET Core 2.0. Search for the `<TargetFramework>` node in the `.csproj` file, and replace its inner text with `netcoreapp2.0`:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App.csproj?range=3)]

Projects targeting .NET Framework should use the TFM of a version greater than or equal to .NET Framework 4.6.1. Search for the `<TargetFramework>` node in the `.csproj` file, and replace its inner text with `net461`:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App.csproj?range=4)]

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Core 2.0 offers a much larger surface area than .NET Core 1.x. If you're targeting .NET Framework solely because of missing APIs in .NET Core 1.x, targeting .NET Core 2.0 is likely to work.

If the project file contains `<RuntimeFrameworkVersion>1.{sub-version}</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>`, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues/3221#issuecomment-413094268).

<a name="global-json"></a>

## Update .NET Core SDK version in global.json

If your solution relies upon a [global.json](/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file to target a specific .NET Core SDK version, update its `version` property to use the 2.0 version installed on your machine:

[!code-json[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/global.json?highlight=3)]

<a name="package-reference"></a>

## Update package references

The `.csproj` file in a 1.x project lists each NuGet package used by the project.

In an ASP.NET Core 2.0 project targeting .NET Core 2.0, a single [metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage) reference in the `.csproj` file replaces the collection of packages:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App.csproj?range=8-10)]

All the features of ASP.NET Core 2.0 and Entity Framework Core 2.0 are included in the metapackage.

ASP.NET Core 2.0 projects targeting .NET Framework should continue to reference individual NuGet packages. Update the `Version` attribute of each `<PackageReference />` node to 2.0.0.

For example, here's the list of `<PackageReference />` nodes used in a typical ASP.NET Core 2.0 project targeting .NET Framework:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App.csproj?range=9-22)]

The package `Microsoft.Extensions.CommandLineUtils` has been [retired](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/blob/release/2.1/README.md).  It is still available but unsupported.

<a name="dot-net-cli-tool-reference"></a>

## Update .NET Core CLI tools

In the `.csproj` file, update the `Version` attribute of each `<DotNetCliToolReference />` node to 2.0.0.

For example, here's the list of CLI tools used in a typical ASP.NET Core 2.0 project targeting .NET Core 2.0:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App.csproj?range=12-16)]

<a name="package-target-fallback"></a>

## Rename Package Target Fallback property

The `.csproj` file of a 1.x project used a `PackageTargetFallback` node and variable:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App.csproj?range=5)]

Rename both the node and variable to `AssetTargetFallback`:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App.csproj?range=4)]

<a name="program-cs"></a>

## Update Main method in Program.cs

In 1.x projects, the `Main` method of `Program.cs` looked like this:

[!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/Program.cs?name=snippet_ProgramCs&highlight=8-19)]

In 2.0 projects, the `Main` method of `Program.cs` has been simplified:

[!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/Program.cs?highlight=8-11)]

The adoption of this new 2.0 pattern is highly recommended and is required for product features like [Entity Framework (EF) Core Migrations](xref:data/ef-mvc/migrations) to work. For example, running `Update-Database` from the Package Manager Console window or `dotnet ef database update` from the command line (on projects converted to ASP.NET Core 2.0) generates the following error:

```
Unable to create an object of type '<Context>'. Add an implementation of 'IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<Context>' to the project, or see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851728 for additional patterns supported at design time.
```

<a name="add-modify-configuration"></a>

## Add configuration providers

In 1.x projects, adding configuration providers to an app was accomplished via the `Startup` constructor. The steps involved creating an instance of `ConfigurationBuilder`, loading applicable providers (environment variables, app settings, etc.), and initializing a member of `IConfigurationRoot`.

[!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/Startup.cs?name=snippet_1xStartup)]

The preceding example loads the `Configuration` member with configuration settings from `appsettings.json` as well as any `appsettings.{Environment}.json` file matching the `IHostingEnvironment.EnvironmentName` property. The location of these files is at the same path as `Startup.cs`.

In 2.0 projects, the boilerplate configuration code inherent to 1.x projects runs behind-the-scenes. For example, environment variables and app settings are loaded at startup. The equivalent `Startup.cs` code is reduced to `IConfiguration` initialization with the injected instance:

[!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/Startup.cs?name=snippet_2xStartup)]

To remove the default providers added by `WebHostBuilder.CreateDefaultBuilder`, invoke the `Clear` method on the `IConfigurationBuilder.Sources` property inside of `ConfigureAppConfiguration`. To add providers back, utilize the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method in `Program.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/Program.cs?name=snippet_ProgramMainConfigProviders&highlight=9-14)]

The configuration used by the `CreateDefaultBuilder` method in the preceding code snippet can be seen [here](https://github.com/aspnet/MetaPackages/blob/rel/2.0.0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore/WebHost.cs#L152).

For more information, see [Configuration in ASP.NET Core](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index).

## Move database initialization code

In 1.x projects using EF Core 1.x, a command such as `dotnet ef migrations add` does the following:

1. Instantiates a `Startup` instance
1. Invokes the `ConfigureServices` method to register all services with dependency injection (including `DbContext` types)
1. Performs its requisite tasks

In 2.0 projects using EF Core 2.0, `Program.BuildWebHost` is invoked to obtain the application services. Unlike 1.x, this has the additional side effect of invoking `Startup.Configure`. If your 1.x app invoked database initialization code in its `Configure` method, unexpected problems can occur. For example, if the database doesn't yet exist, the seeding code runs before the EF Core Migrations command execution. This problem causes a `dotnet ef migrations list` command to fail if the database doesn't yet exist.

Consider the following 1.x seed initialization code in the `Configure` method of `Startup.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/Startup.cs?name=snippet_ConfigureSeedData&highlight=8)]

In 2.0 projects, move the `SeedData.Initialize` call to the `Main` method of `Program.cs`:

[!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2App/Program2.cs?name=snippet_Main2Code&highlight=10)]

As of 2.0, it's bad practice to do anything in `BuildWebHost` except build and configure the web host. Anything that's about running the application should be handled outside of `BuildWebHost` &mdash; typically in the `Main` method of `Program.cs`.

<a name="view-compilation"></a>

## Review Razor view compilation setting

Faster application startup time and smaller published bundles are of utmost importance to you. For these reasons, [Razor view compilation](xref:mvc/views/view-compilation) is enabled by default in ASP.NET Core 2.0.

Setting the `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish` property to true is no longer required. Unless you're disabling view compilation, the property may be removed from the `.csproj` file.

When targeting .NET Framework, you still need to explicitly reference the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation) NuGet package in your `.csproj` file:

[!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetFx2.0App.csproj?range=15)]

<a name="app-insights"></a>

## Rely on Application Insights "light-up" features

Effortless setup of application performance instrumentation is important. You can now rely on the new [Application Insights](/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview) "light-up" features available in the Visual Studio 2017 tooling.

ASP.NET Core 1.1 projects created in Visual Studio 2017 added Application Insights by default. If you're not using the Application Insights SDK directly, outside of `Program.cs` and `Startup.cs`, follow these steps:

1. If targeting .NET Core, remove the following `<PackageReference />` node from the `.csproj` file:

    [!code-xml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App.csproj?range=10)]

2. If targeting .NET Core, remove the `UseApplicationInsights` extension method invocation from `Program.cs`:

    [!code-csharp[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/Program.cs?name=snippet_ProgramCsMain&highlight=8)]

3. Remove the Application Insights client-side API call from `_Layout.cshtml`. It comprises the following two lines of code:

    [!code-cshtml[](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1App/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml?range=1,19&dedent=4)]

If you are using the Application Insights SDK directly, continue to do so. The 2.0 [metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage) includes the latest version of Application Insights, so a package downgrade error appears if you're referencing an older version.

## Adopt authentication/Identity improvements

ASP.NET Core 2.0 has a new authentication model and a number of significant changes to ASP.NET Core Identity. If you created your project with Individual User Accounts enabled, or if you have manually added authentication or Identity, see [Migrate Authentication and Identity to ASP.NET Core 2.0](xref:migration/1x-to-2x/identity-2x).
