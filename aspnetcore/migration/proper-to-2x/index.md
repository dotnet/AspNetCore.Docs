# Upgrade from ASP.NET Framework to ASP.NET Core

 :::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-7.0"

## Why upgrade to the latest .NET

ASP.NET Core is the modern web framework for .NET. While ASP.NET Core has many similarities to ASP.NET in the .NET Framework, it is a completely new framework completely rewritten. ASP.NET apps migrated to ASP.NET Core can benefit from improved performance and access to the latest web development features.

## ASP.NET Framework update approaches

Most non-trivial ASP.NET Framework apps should consider using the [incremental upgrade](xref:migration/inc/overview) approach. For more information, see [Incremental ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core upgrade](/aspnet/core/migration/inc/overview).

<!--
Visual Studio has tooling to help migrate ASP.NET apps to ASP.NET Core. For more information, see [Upgrading your .NET projects with Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant-now-in-visual-studio/).  Update this link to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/ when those doc's are updated.-->
The Visual Studio extension [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.upgradeassistant) can help upgrade ASP.NET Framework web apps to ASP.NET Core. For more information see the blog post [Upgrading your .NET projects with Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant-now-in-visual-studio/).

## URI decoding differences between ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core has the following URI decoding differences with ASP.NET Framework:

| ASCII   | Encoded | ASP.NET Core | ASP.NET Framework |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `\` | `%5C`  |  `\` |  `/` |
| `/` | `%2F`  |  `%2F` |  `/` |

When decoding `%2F` on ASP.NET Core:

* The entire path gets unescaped except `%2F` because converting it to `/` would change the path structure. It canâ€™t be decoded until the path is split into segments.

To generate the value for `HttpRequest.Url`, use `new Uri(this.AspNetCoreHttpRequest.GetEncodedUrl());` to avoid `Uri` misinterpreting the values.
