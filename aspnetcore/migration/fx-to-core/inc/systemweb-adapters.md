# System.Web adapters

The main use case of the adapters in the [dotnet/systemweb-adapters](https://github.com/dotnet/systemweb-adapters) repository is to help developers who have taken a reliance on `System.Web` types within their class libraries as they want to move to ASP.NET Core.

An important feature of the adapters is the adapters allow the library to be used from ***both*** ASP.NET Framework and ASP.NET Core projects. Updating multiple ASP.NET Framework apps to ASP.NET Core often involves intermediate states where not all the apps have been fully updated. By using the `System.Web` adapters, the library can be used both from ASP.NET Core callers and ASP.NET Framework callers that haven't been upgraded.

Let's take a look at an example using the adapters moving from .NET Framework to ASP.NET Core.

## Packages

* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters`: This package is used in supporting libraries and provides the System.Web APIs you may have taken a dependency on, such as `HttpContext` and others. This package targets .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.5+, and .NET 5+.
* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.FrameworkServices`: This package only targets .NET Framework and is intended to provide services to ASP.NET Framework applications that may need to provide incremental migrations. This is generally not expected to be referenced from libraries, but rather from the applications themselves.
* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.CoreServices`: This package only targets .NET 6+ and is intended to provide services to ASP.NET Core applications to configure behavior of `System.Web` APIs as well as opting into any behaviors for incremental migration. This is generally not expected to be referenced from libraries, but rather from the applications themselves.
* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.Abstractions`: This package is a supporting package that provides abstractions for services used by both the ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET Framework application such as session state serialization.

### Converting to System.Web.HttpContext

To convert between the two representations of HttpContext, you may do the following:

For <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext> to <xref:System.Web.HttpContext>:

* Implicit casting
* `HttpContext.AsSystemWeb()`

For <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext>

* Implicit casting
* `HttpContext.AsAspNetCore()`

Both of these methods will use a cached <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> representation for the duration of a request. This allows for targeted rewrites to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext> as needed.

## Example

### ASP.NET Framework

Consider a controller that does something such as:

```cs
public class SomeController : Controller
{
  public ActionResult Index()
  {
    SomeOtherClass.SomeMethod(HttpContext.Current);
  }
}
```

which then has logic in a separate assembly passing that <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> around until finally, some inner method does some logic on it such as:

```cs
public class Class2
{
  public bool PerformSomeCheck(HttpContext context)
  {
    return context.Request.Headers["SomeHeader"] == "ExpectedValue";
  }
}
```

### ASP.NET Core

In order to run the above logic in ASP.NET Core, a developer will need to add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters` package, that will enable the projects to work on both platforms.

The libraries would need to be updated to understand the adapters, but it will be as simple as adding the package and recompiling. If these are the only dependencies a system has on `System.Web.dll`, then the libraries will be able to target [.NET Standard 2.0](/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-0) to facilitate a simpler building process while migrating.

The controller in ASP.NET Core will now look like this:

```cs
public class SomeController : Controller
{
  [Route("/")]
  public IActionResult Index()
  {
    SomeOtherClass.SomeMethod(HttpContext);
  }
}
```

Notice that since there's a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase.HttpContext> property, they can pass that through, but it generally looks the same. Using implicit conversions, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext> can be converted into the adapter that could then be passed around through the levels utilizing the code in the same way.

## Unit Testing

When unit testing code that uses the System.Web adapters, there are some special considerations to keep in mind.

In most cases, there's no need to set up additional components for running tests. But if the component being tested uses <xref:System.Web.HttpRuntime>, it might be necessary to start up the `SystemWebAdapters` service, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/migration/fx-to-core/inc/samples/unit-testing/Program.cs" id="snippet_UnitTestingFixture" :::

The tests must be executed in sequence, not in parallel. The preceding example illustrates how to achieve this by setting [XUnit's `DisableParallelization` option](https://xunit.net/docs/running-tests-in-parallel#parallelism-in-test-frameworks) to `true`. This setting disables parallel execution for a specific test collection, ensuring that the tests within that collection run one after the other, without concurrency.
