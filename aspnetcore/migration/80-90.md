# Migrate from ASP.NET Core 8.0 to 9.0

This article explains how to update an existing ASP.NET Core 8.0 project to ASP.NET Core 9.0.

## Prerequisites

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-vs-9.0.md)]

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-vsc-9.0.md)]

## Update the .NET SDK version in `global.json`

If you rely on a [`global.json`](/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file to target a specific .NET Core SDK version, update the `version` property to the .NET 8.0 SDK version that's installed. For example:

```diff
{
  "sdk": {
-    "version": "8.0.100"
+    "version": "9.0.100"
  }
}
```

## Update the target framework

Update the project file's [Target Framework Moniker (TFM)](/dotnet/standard/frameworks) to `net8.0`:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
-    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
+    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

<!-- New content should be added to ~/migration/includes/aspnetcore-9/includes/{FILE}.md files. This will help prevent merge conflicts in this file. -->
