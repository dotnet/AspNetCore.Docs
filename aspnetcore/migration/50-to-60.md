# Migrate from ASP.NET Core 5.0 to 6.0

This article explains how to update an existing ASP.NET Core 5.0 project to ASP.NET Core 6.0.

## Prerequisites

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-vs-6.0.md)]

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-vsc-6.0.md)]

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-mac)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-mac-6.0.md)]

## Update .NET SDK version in global.json

If you rely upon a [global.json](/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file to target a specific .NET SDK version, update the `version` property to the .NET 6.0 SDK version that's installed. For example:

```diff
{
  "sdk": {
-    "version": "5.0.100"
+    "version": "6.0.100-preview.2.21155.3"
  }
}
```

## Update the target framework

Update the project file's [Target Framework Moniker (TFM)](/dotnet/standard/frameworks) to `net6.0`:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
-    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
+    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Update package references

In the project file, update each [Microsoft.AspNetCore.*](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.AspNetCore.*) and [Microsoft.Extensions.*](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.Extensions.*) package reference's `Version` attribute to 6.0.0 or later. For example:

```diff
<ItemGroup>
-    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch" Version="5.0.3" />
-    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions" Version="5.0.0" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch" Version="6.0.0-preview.2.*" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions" Version="6.0.0-preview.2.*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Update Docker images

For apps using Docker, update your *Dockerfile* `FROM` statements and scripts. Use a base image that includes the ASP.NET Core 6.0 runtime. Consider the following `docker pull` command difference between ASP.NET Core 5.0 and 6.0:

```diff
- docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0
+ docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
```

## Changes to the ASP.NET Core Razor SDK

The Razor compiler now leverages the new [source generators feature](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/) to generate compiled C# files from the Razor views and pages in a project. In previous versions:

* The compilation relied on the `RazorGenerate` and `RazorCompile` targets to produce the generated code. These targets are no longer valid. In .NET 6, both code generation and compilation are supported by a single call to the compiler. `RazorComponentGenerateDependsOn` is still supported to specify dependencies that are required before the build runs.
* A separate Razor assembly, `AppName.Views.dll`, was generated that contained the compiled view types in an application. This behavior has been deprecated and a single assembly `AppName.dll` is produced that contains both the app types and the generated views.
* The app types in `AppName.Views.dll` were public. In .NET 6, the app types are in `AppName.dll` but are `internal sealed`. Apps doing type discover on `AppName.Views.dll` won't be able to do type discover on `AppName.dll`. The following shows the API change:

```diff
- public class Views_Home_Index : global::Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorPage<dynamic>
+ internal sealed class Views_Home_Index : global::Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorPage<dynamic>
```

Make the following changes:

* The following properties are no longer applicable with the single-step compilation model.
  * `RazorTargetAssemblyAttribute`
  * `RazorTargetName`
  * `EnableDefaultRazorTargetAssemblyInfoAttributes`
  * `UseRazorBuildServer`
  * `GenerateRazorTargetAssemblyInfo`
  * `GenerateMvcApplicationPartsAssemblyAttributes`

For more information, see [Razor compiler no longer produces a Views assembly](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/459).

## Project templates use Duende Identity Server

Project templates now use [Duende Identity Server](https://docs.duendesoftware.com). For migration guidance, see [IdentityServer4 v4.1 to Duende IdentityServer v5](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v5/upgrades/is4_v4_to_dis_v5/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Duende Identity Server is an open source product with a reciprocal license agreement. If you plan to use Duende Identity Server in production, you might be required to obtain a commercial licence from [Duende Software](https://duendesoftware.com/) and pay a license fee. For more information, see [Duende Software: Licenses](https://aka.ms/identityserverlicense).
>
> To learn how to use [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) for ASP.NET Core Identity, see [Identity (dotnet/aspnetcore GitHub repository)](https://aka.ms/aspnetidentityserver).

Add a `DbSet<Key>` property named `Keys` to every `IdentityDbContext` to satisfy a new requirement from the updated version of `IPersistedGrantDbContext`. The keys are required as part of the contract with Duende Identity Server's stores.

```csharp
public DbSet<Key> Keys { get; set; }
```

> [!NOTE]
> Existing migrations must be recreated for Duende Identity Server.

## Review breaking changes

For breaking changes from .NET 5.0 to .NET 6.0, see [Breaking changes for migration from version 5.0 to 6.0](/dotnet/core/compatibility/6.0). ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core are also included in the list.
