# Migrate from ASP.NET Framework to ASP.NET Core

This guide helps you migrate your ASP.NET Framework application to ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core is the modern, cross-platform web framework for .NET that offers improved performance, better tooling, and access to the latest web development features.

## Choose Your Migration Approach

The right migration approach depends on your application's complexity, timeline, and constraints:

### ðŸ”„ Incremental Migration (Recommended for Most Apps)

**Best for:**
- Large, complex applications with extensive business logic
- Production applications that cannot afford extended downtime  
- Teams transitioning to ASP.NET Core gradually
- Applications with tight coupling to ASP.NET Framework APIs

**How it works:**
- Set up ASP.NET Core app as a proxy using [YARP](https://dotnet.github.io/yarp/)
- Gradually migrate routes from Framework to Core
- Use System.Web adapters to minimize code changes
- Maintain production deployments throughout migration

> [!TIP]
> The incremental approach follows the [Strangler Fig pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler-fig), allowing you to migrate piece by piece while keeping your application running in production.

### ðŸ”§ Full Migration

**Best for:**
- Smaller applications with limited complexity
- Green-field rewrites where you want to modernize architecture
- Applications with minimal ASP.NET Framework-specific dependencies
- Long maintenance windows available

**How it works:**
- Create new ASP.NET Core project from scratch
- Port code and functionality systematically
- Replace ASP.NET Framework patterns with ASP.NET Core equivalents
- Test and deploy complete new application

## Technology-Specific Guidance

### ASP.NET MVC and Web API
- **Incremental:** [MVC/Web API Incremental Migration](xref:migration/incremental/mvc-webapi)
- **Full Migration:** [MVC/Web API Full Migration](xref:migration/full-migration/mvc-webapi)

> [!NOTE]
> Most MVC and Web API applications benefit from the incremental approach, especially when using dependency injection, custom filters, or extensive business logic.

### ASP.NET Web Forms
- **Incremental:** [Web Forms Incremental Migration](xref:migration/incremental/web-forms)  
- **Full Migration:** [Web Forms to Razor Pages/MVC](xref:migration/full-migration/web-forms)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Web Forms applications often require significant architectural changes. The incremental approach can help you migrate gradually while learning ASP.NET Core patterns.

### Custom HTTP Modules and Handlers
- **Incremental:** [HTTP Modules with System.Web Adapters](xref:migration/incremental/http-modules)
- **Full Migration:** [HTTP Modules to Middleware](xref:migration/full-migration/http-modules)

## Common Migration Scenarios

### Authentication and Authorization
Both migration approaches need to handle authentication:
- **Incremental:** [Share authentication between Framework and Core](xref:migration/incremental/authentication)
- **Full Migration:** [Migrate to ASP.NET Core Identity](xref:migration/full-migration/identity)

### Session State
Session state requires special handling:
- **Incremental:** [Share session state across applications](xref:migration/incremental/session-state)
- **Full Migration:** [Migrate to ASP.NET Core session](xref:migration/full-migration/session-state)

### Configuration
- **Incremental:** Use both Web.config and appsettings.json during transition
- **Full Migration:** [Complete configuration migration](xref:migration/full-migration/configuration)

## Planning Your Migration

Before starting any migration approach:

1. **Assess Your Application**
   - Identify ASP.NET Framework dependencies
   - Evaluate third-party library compatibility
   - Analyze authentication and session requirements

2. **Prepare Your Environment**
   - Upgrade supporting libraries to .NET Standard 2.0 when possible  
   - Set up development and testing environments for ASP.NET Core
   - Plan deployment and rollback strategies

3. **Consider Migration Tools**
   - [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.upgradeassistant) for automated assistance
   - [.NET Portability Analyzer](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/analyzers/portability-analyzer) for compatibility assessment
