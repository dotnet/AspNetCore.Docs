# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
# Initial experience with this file was not all positive, so most lines are currently commented out.
# It will be easy to give it another trial should we decide to do that.

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# *     

# .github/  

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
