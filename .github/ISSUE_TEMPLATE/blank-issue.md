# Before you open an issue

If the issue is with an ASP.NET Core document:

* Do **not** open a new issue using this form.
* Open the issue using the **Open a documentation issue** link and feedback form at the bottom of the article. 

Using the **Open a documentation issue** link and form to open an issue adds article metadata for tracking, which indicates the article that you're commenting on and pings the author for a faster response.

If the issue is:

* A simple typo or similar correction, you can submit a PR. See the Contributor Guide for instructions: https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/#quick-edits-to-existing-documents
