            This issue has been marked for triage on the Blazor Docs GitHub project, and I'll respond as soon as I return from the Thanksgiving holiday vacation on Monday, November 27.

            We only work on documentation on this repo. If you need product support, close this issue and seek assistance through one or more of the following support channels:

            * [Stack Overflow (tagged: 'blazor')](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/blazor)
            * [General ASP.NET Core Slack Team](https://aspnetcore.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1mv5487zb-EOZxJ1iqb0A0ajowEbxByQ#/shared-invite/email)
            * [Blazor Gitter](https://gitter.im/aspnet/Blazor)

            If you think that you found a potential bug in the framework or have product feedback, close this issue and open a new issue for the ASP.NET Core product unit at [dotnet/aspnetcore issues](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues). Bug reports require a clear explanation of the problem, usually including a minimal repro project placed on GitHub for the product unit engineers to download and run. If you determine with the product unit that it isn't a bug but merely requires documentation, please re-open this docs issue and place a cross-link to your engineering issue discussion.

            For problems or feedback on Visual Studio, close this issue and use the [**Report a Problem**](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio) or [**Suggest a Feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/suggest-a-feature) processes from within VS, which open internal issues for the VS product unit. For more information, see [Visual Studio Feedback](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/home).

            For problems with Visual Studio Code, close this issue and ask for support on community support forums. For bug reports and product feedback, open an issue on the [microsoft/vscode GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).`
